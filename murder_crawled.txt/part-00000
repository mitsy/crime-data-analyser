http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:15:52 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is one of the accused in the case.    He had challenged the decision of the special CBI court in Panchkula when the court refused to examine more witnesses of the dera head in the case. According to CBI, Ranjit, who had distanced himself from the dera, was called to Sirsa in June 2002 and threatened by accused Avtar Singh and Inder Sain to seek apology from Gurmeet Ram Rahim for having circulated anonymous letters.    However, when Ranjit did not agree, they allegedly threatened him to be ready to face the consequences. According to the premier agency, thereafter, Avtar, Inder Sain, Krishan Lal, Jasbir Singh and Sabdil Singh allegedly hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Ranjit.    After serving tea to his father, who was working in the fields, on July 10, 2002, in Khanpur Kolian village of Kurukshetra district, Ranjit left on his motorcycle. On the way, four people fired at him and fled from the spot. Ranjit died of bullet injuries. One of the CBI witnesses in the case had earlier deposed before the court that Gurmeet Ram Rahim had ordered to eliminate Ranjit.    However, the witness had later turned hostile. While other accused were arrested in the case, Gurmeet Ram Rahim is on bail. The trial of the case is pending before the CBI court.  ||CHANDIGARH

Ali Chaklani, a resident of East Street in Camp, has been charged under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. He has been sent to police custody till August 28, said V A Ingle, sub-inspector of the Mundhwa police station.     Jay Haresh Sumayya, 38-year-old resident of Andheri, Mumbai, lodged the complaint against the suspect on Monday but police got the details only on Thursday.     Ingle said that on Sunday night, Sumayya, his foreign national friend and two more friends, Alap Joshi and Viven Kedari, had gone to the restaurant for dinner. Chaklani was also there.     While they were having dinner, the suspect allegedly pushed the woman. When Sumayya confronted him, the suspect pushed and brushed against her again, which triggered a fight between Sumayya and Chaklani, he said.     "Chaklani ran into the kitchen and came out with a knife. He threatened to kill Sumayya and attacked him. Sumayya's head got injured in the fight. When Joshi and Kedari went to help, Chaklani attacked them with the knife," Ingle said.     Kedari sustained injury near his nose, while Joshi's left wrist was wounded in the attack. "They were taken to a nearby hospital and are out of danger," Ingle said.     The suspect was arrested on Monday night after receiving the complaint from Sumayya. "Chaklani helps his father in their family steel business," he said.     The complainant and the foreign national woman stay in Mumbai. "We are investigating further," Ingle added.     The suspect allegedly pushed the woman. When her friend and the complainant, Sumayya, confronted him, the suspect pushed and brushed against her again, which triggered a fight.||PUNE

Police revealed on Thursday that the accused had pumped five bullets into the body of his son and even forced celphos insecticide tablets into his granddaughter's mouth after killing her.    Sukhdev Singh, 56, killed his granddaughter Sidak and son Dilawar Singh before ending his life by taking poison. Police have recovered sachets of poisonous insecticide from the crime spot. The details emerged during the autopsy of the victims conducted on Thursday at Government Medical College, Patiala.    "The autopsy revealed that Dilawar had received five bullet injuries whereas Sidak received one. It has also come to light that celphos was forced into Sidak's mouth after killing her," said inspector Bharpur Singh, SHO of Civil Lines, where the case had been registered.    Police said besides a domestic discord with his daughter-in-law, Sukhwinder was also disturbed about the future of his granddaughter who was suffering from physical disability.    Sukhdev's wife is working as a teacher at Sangrur, while Dilawar's wife Wattandeep Kaur is working with the Army on a clerical post in Patiala. Dilawar, a pharmacy graduate, was unemployed.    Meanwhile, acting on the statement given by Sukhdev's wife and the suicide note left by him, police have also booked Wattandeep and her father Ajaib Singh under Section 306 of the IPC for abetting the suicide.

In the evening, the suspended members met Governor O P Kohli and demanded imposition of the President's rule in the state as the BJP-led government 'failed to save lives of the people'.     Vaghela along with state party president Bharatsinh Solanki, national spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil, and other MLAs submitted a memorandum to the governor seeking resignation of chief minister Anandiben Patel and imposition of the President's rule. NCP president Jayant Patel also supported the Congress demand.     "The present government has completely failed in maintaining law and order in the state. It has misused police to terrorize the common citizens after its atrocities against the Patidar community rally in Ahmedabad. Increase in serious crimes like murder, loot, rape has shaken the faith of the citizens in the government, so the state needs to be put under the President's rule," the memorandum claims.     The Congress moved a resolution in the House demanding adjournment of the assembly and a motion to condole death of 10 youths who died during police firing or in the rioting. Vaghela drew a parallel between the situations in the state after the post-Godhra riots of 2002 and the Patel Amanat Andolan.     Vaghela said that after the Godhra riots, the then BJP MLA Mayaben Kodnani had moved a similar motion and the House was adjourned. He said that the situation was similar to the 2002 and hence the House should be adjourned.     However, the Speaker intervened and said that one cannot draw a parallel between 2002 and 2015 incidents. When the demand was turned down, the Congress members started shouting slogans in protest.     Earlier, as the House assembled at 12 noon, the Congress demanded a debate on the violence in the state after the August 25 Patidar Anamat Andolan rally in Ahmedabad.||GNDHINAGAR
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/The-mystery-of-stone-age-arsenal/articleshow/48703816.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||KOLKATA: Police were caught unprepared both by the intensity of the Left movement on Thursday and the amount of 'arsenal' at the cadres' disposal.     The barrage of bricks and stones was so severe that even riot cops in protective gear scampered for safety. Where did the Left rallyists get so many stones?     TOI was there when the brickbatting started on Dufferin Road at 1.30pm. Left supporters had smashed through a third barricade, and police charged them headlong. Immediately, scores of Left cadres started picking up bricks lining the lawns at Maidan club tents.     With military precision, an assembly line of sorts formed. Some cadres broke the bricks into fist-sized chunks, while others passed them hand over hand to the frontlines, where younger cadres were hurling them at cops.     The Left cadres seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of missiles, prompting senior police officers and minister Subrata Mukherjee to allege that the rallyists had brought the arsenal with them.     The street battles shut down the city centre from 1pm to 4pm. All roads leading to Esplanade were clogged with bumper-to-bumper traffic. AJC Bose Road flyover was closed. Main thoroughfares like SN Banerjee Road, JL Nehru Road, Ganesh Avenue, CR Avenue and Park Street were choked.     As the turnout of protesters exceeded expectations, the "mutually-agreed" arrangement between Left leaders and police went haywire. "Leaders had agreed that they would be stopped at Dufferin Road where they would submit a memorandum to police and disperse," said a senior police officer. Later, state Kisan Sabha president Madan Ghosh, shot back: "The CM was not there. Who will we give a memorandum? In The Trinamool government, the CM is the only mantri. The rest are santris (guards)."     At Red Road, the rally was peaceful. At Kidderpore, too, there wasn't much trouble. In fact, a CPM MP asked police in Kidderpore why they were lathicharging rallyists when not a single stone had not been pelted. Police immediately restrained themselves.     Two bombs exploded off Kona Expressway during the clash. Left leaders denied any responsibility. "Instead, Trinamool and police attacked us at several points," said Hannan Mollah, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha.     More than 50 policemen in Kolkata and Howrah were injured. Special commissioner (II) Soumen Mitra took hits on his chest, hands and legs. The visor on his helmet had shattered. DC-traffic V Solomon Neesakumar was injured in a hand and leg. An ASI suffered a rib fracture and a constable had a shoulder dislocation. Joint commissioner Supratim Sarkar was admitted to a nursing home.     Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee summoned Kolkata Police commissioner Surojit Kar Purakayastha to her Kalighat house. Police have registered a case under attempted murder and rioting.||KOLKATA

The girl was allegedly killed by her boyfriend as she had turned indifferent towards him. Though the boyfriend is still at large, his friend, who helped him in the crime, has been arrested.     Dipika Das, a student at Vivekananda Kishore Bharati School in Maheshtala, left her aunt's home at Begor Khal in the town on Tuesday evening to attend her tutorial class, but she never returned. Her uncle and aunt, with whom Dipika lived ever since she was orphaned 12 years ago, starting asking their friends and relatives about Dipika. Failing to find her, her uncle, Sukdeb Mukherjee, lodged a missing person's complaint at the Maheshtala police station the next morning.     On Wednesday evening, Sukdeb was asked by the police to identify a girl's body found in a field in the town. Her head and face had been smashed, making her unrecognizable, the police said. But Sukdeb reportedly identified the body as that of his niece, from her clothes.     The police found the body beside an abandoned cycle. On questioning residents of Bagpota, where the field was located, the police learnt two youths, Dipanjan and Sujay, were last seen riding the cycle, which belonged to Dipanjan.     The residents led the police to the two friends' homes. While Dipanjan had fled, Sujay was brought to the Maheshtala police station. Sujay broke down and confessed that Dipanjan had roped him in. He told police they strangled Dipika and bludgeoned her head with a boulder. She was Dipanjan's girlfriend for three years, but of late, she had become disinterested, Sujay said, adding Dipanjan turned vengeful and killed her.     South 24-Parganas SP Sunil Chaudhury said, "It is a murder of revenge over an affair gone sour. We have arrested Sujay. We are searching for Dipanjan."||KOLKATA

In fact, Indrani had booked a hotel room at Worli so that Khanna could fly in from Kolkata on the day of the incident.The submission made by Mumbai police at the Alipore court claimed Indrani had told them how she had recceed Raigad's Pen area with her driver Shyam Rai on April 23 to "identify the exact spot where to dispose of the body". She then called up Khanna and apprised him of her plan. Khanna, however, said he was called to Mumbai by Indrani to meet their own daughter, Vidhie, and not Sheena. He claimed he had climbed into the SUV driven by Shyam along with Indrani but had dozed off a few minutes later. He claimed that when he woke up he found Sheena dead near him.Khanna though could not answer two crucial questions â€” one, whether Sheena did not even try to raise her voice while being murdered and two, why he kept mum for over three years even after realizing that Sheena had been murdered.Meanwhile, the local Alipore city court on Thursday granted Mumbai police Khanna's five-day remand after rejecting his bail plea. Chief judicial magistrate, Alipore Court, Rajesh Chakraborty accepted the remand prayer and directed police to produce him before a designated Mumbai court by September 1. The judge rejected the bail prayer of Khanna, who claimed he was innocent saying the case diary was strong enough not to grant him bail.Khanna had even joined Indrani, claimed police sources, in threatening driver Rai who was paid Rs1 lakh for the job. Rai also told the police that he was threatened by both Indrani and Khanna that if he told anyone about the murder, then he too would meet the same fate.||KOLKATA
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/I-knew-Sheena-was-Indranis-daughter/articleshow/48703534.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||  Mumbai: Peter Mukerjea, whose wife Indrani was arrested on Tuesday for murdering her daughter Sheena Bora, admitted on Thursday in an interview to Times Now that Sheena herself had told him she was Indrani's daughter and not her sister.    Mukerjea, former CEO of Star India and promoter of INX Media, had earlier said it was only his son Rahul who had told him that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, and that he had disbelieved him as his wife claimed she was her sister. Rahul, Mukerjea's son from his first marriage, was in a relationship with Sheena, which Peter said Indrani disapproved of. Police suspect the case to be one of honour killing.    Peter told Times Now that sometime around 2011, "Sheena had told me that... Indrani has given you wrong information. I am not her sister, I am actually her daughter."    However, he chose not to believe her but his wife who strongly refuted any such suggestion, he said.    Peter had on Wednesday said he was "dumbstruck by the level of criminality" in the case. However, asked on Thursday if he believed his wife, co-founder of a broadcast company, was the murderer, he said, "Certainly not" and added he believed "a person is innocent until proven guilty."    Peter, at the same time, admitted there were "disagreements from time to time" between Indrani and Sheena and though he did not know what they were about, he knew Indrani "had problems with Sheena's relationship with Rahul".    Asked if Sheena was a source of conflict in the family, Peter said, "Not Sheena, but it was the relationship that was the cause of conflict."    In April 2012, the month in which she was killed, Peter said he was abroad but he knew Indrani was "coming to Mumbai to meet with her brother Michail and that the two of them had worked out along with blessings from parents that they would make sure Sheena was moved to Guwahati and from then the plan was that she could go overseas and study in the US."    Asked why, after Indrani told him Sheena had moved to the US, he had not made any attempt to raise questions about how a person could disappear into thin air, Peter replied, "I don't think she ever disappeared into thin air."    Police are probing if a possible property and money dispute was behind the murder. Peter said there were no financial or property issues between Indrani and Sheena.  ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Van-killings-Blame-game-escalates/articleshow/48703491.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The blame game between Delhi Police and the Tihar administration over Tuesday's clash in a jail van is getting uglier. The jail authorities have alleged cops are making false and malicious statements to hide their own "lapses". Delhi Police on Wednesday and Thursday released statements alleging that Tihar did not share proper information about inmates and their rivalry in advance due to which Neeraj Bawana and his rival Paras happened to travel in the same van and clashed subsequently. Paras and Pradip Bhola were killed in Tuesday's clash.While Delhi Police has accused the jail authorities of shedding responsibility, the latter has termed these allegations motivated. Both sides have claimed to have shared information with each other. Both parties have quoted sub-sections of the same standing order and the jail manual rule (25) to justify their points. Tihar has quoted the rule to highlight that the police commissioner would provide information about threat perception of inmates in writing to the jail administration. "The same rule says that if the jail superintendent has sufficient reasons to believe that the inmate is dangerous and it has not been so reported by the police, he shall seek information about the same from the local police," one of police statements says."The press release of Delhi Police (issued on Wednesday) is malicious, not based on facts and an attempt to tarnish the image of Delhi prisons by spreading falsehood. DAP is solely entrusted with the responsibility of safe custody and escorting of prisoners of Delhi prisons during production to various authorized places in the city, outside Delhi, hospitals in Delhi...," a statement by the Tihar administration read. Tihar said they send advance programmes before the inmates are produced in courts. The programme mentions the status of an inmate on the top of a production warrant in bold letters. "In the case of Tuesday's incident, the status of all the 9 under-trials was mentioned as high-risk prisoners. Vikram alias Paras was additionally described as escapee," Tihar statement said."The falsehood being spread by 3rd battalion is further nailed by their letter dated June 2 addressed to the commandant of Tamil Nadu special police in which they have submitted a list of 18 prisoners and details of 18 gangs. Here, the names of criminals involved in murder in DAP van on Tuesday are clearly mentioned with description. It clearly proves that the status of these undertrial prisoners and other high-risk prisoners was well in the knowledge of DAP," the Tihar statement said. The jail authorities also claimed that a communication received from the special cell on June 26, 2015 was forwarded to the DCP 3rd battalion and others. They said the letter contains details about some of the prisoners involved in the incident on August 25.||NEW DELHI

Mohammad Rafiqan Khan (30) a resident of Amrut nagar in Mumbra was found lying unconscious on the service road near Saket complex was located by the patrolling staff of the Rabodi police station at around 3.25am.     "Khan was found in an unconscious state on the side of the road when the patrolling party on bike found him alive. Hence, the constables alerted the control room and also stopped a passing four wheeler and took him to the Thane civil hospital," said a police officer.     Khan was declared dead after a while and his body has been sent for post-mortem to JJ hospital. Though the two bullet marks on his body was visible, the autopsy shall confirmed whether he was assaulted or not. Also, Khan could not give dying declaration to the policemen attending him at the hospital.     "It is suspected that Khan was shot elsewhere and was dumped on the road side however it is unclear as the reason behind the murder and who all are involved. Further investigations shall reveal the mystery behind as a team is already working on the case," said a police officer.     The officer hinted that they are considering all the angles in the investigations including the political but refused to reveal anything on the direction of inquiries.     A case has been registered at Kapurbawdi police station under section 302 of Indian Penal Code and section 3 and 25 of Arms act against the unknown accused.||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Grandparents-are-Sheenas-mom-dad-on-birth-certificate/articleshow/48704559.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||GUWAHATI: The persistent silence of Mikhail, Sheena Bora's younger brother, on the identity of their biological father and the manner in which his sister's birth certificate was registered led to some unanswered questions on Thursday.    Two days after his mother Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Mikhail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed what he gave the police was enough to prove Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora, who are actually Indrani's parents, as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. However, many questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter. In many cases in India involving single mothers, grandparents are known to put in their names as father and mother.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:02 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Additional sessions judge M S Kshirsagar found Laxman Dandekar (55) and his son Sachin (30) guilty of killing Sakharam Kavra in Dahanu in 2011.     While Kavra (30) was from Zadipada village in Dahanu, the Dandekars were from neighbouring Ganganaon. Though they belonged to the same tribal community, Laxman was against the relationship and told the couple to call it off. When Laxman found out that his daughter continued to meet Kavra, he lost his cool. On January 22, 2011, when Kavra was returning from work on his bicycle, Laxman and Sachin intercepted him. An argument ensued and they assaulted Kavra on the head with a hammer. He was rushed to Talasari rural hospital, but was declared dead. Cops later arrested the duo.     Public prosecutor Pervez Patel examined two witnesses who were with Kavra at the time of the incident. "While one turned hostile, the other proved how the duo killed the victim," said Patel.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Khanna-a-jolly-good-fellow-a-doer-Kolkata-friends/articleshow/48703168.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to school at Mayo College in Ajmer. Later Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was apparently not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend of Khanna. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber", he said. "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "The reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news." Rawla, who was in the news himself a few years ago when his 13-year-old son committed suicide after being caned, is now trying to cope with the case. "I've had my share of tragedy and if any of this is true, I hope justice is served."     No one seems to know about any recent interactions between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie paid a visit to Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him in Kolkata at Hastings)."     While speculations abound, if virtual presence is anything to go by, Khanna's posts on "karma" on Facebook in the weeks and months following Sheena's murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; " Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48703211.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||  NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi high court order acquitting former Congress functionary Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.    A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.    The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.    Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's south Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farmhouse by a group of hired gangsters.    The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accused- Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.    While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi Police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.    "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.    Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.  ||NEW DELHI

When asked, the man reportedly admitted that he had got intimate with Sheena, who he believed was her sister.Sheena, on her part, allegedly told Indrani that she was pregnant with the child of the man and that she would not just keep it but also "unaccounted" money in her name in a foreign bank.||MUMBAI

Here is the full text:    Arnab Goswami: What do you know about the circumstances that led to this murder? The motive.    Peter Mukerjea: I am completely in a state of dismay and shock. I have absolutely no idea this had taken place. Even till today, I believe a person is innocent until proven guilty. And I think let the law take its own course. Let the police do their investigation fully, completely and transparently, and truth will prevail.    Arnab: Did you know Sheena was Indrani's daughter?    Peter: Certainly not. I had no idea Sheena was Indrani's daughter; in fact I was told before we got married that Indrani had a brother and sister and Sheena was the sister and Michail the brother. Sheena at some later time pointed out that that information was incorrect.    Arnab: What do you mean pointed out?    Peter: Sheena had told me that Jiju, she used to call me Jiju, she said Jiju this is not correct. Indrani has given you wrong information. And please believe me.    Arnab: Believe what?    Peter: That I am not her sister, I am actually her daughter.    Arnab: She told you that?    Peter: She told me that. And of course I could not take that at face value, because all these years I'd believed she was Indrani's sister. Indrani had told me about it. I had confronted Indrani about it and Indrani had said it was utter rubbish. And that it had been fed to Sheena from somewhere else.    Arnab: Did your son Rahul who was going around with Sheena tell you Indrani was Sheena's mother and not sister?    Peter: Rahul echoed exactly what Sheena had said.    Arnab: When did Sheena tell you this and why didn't you believe her?    Peter Mukerjea: I am not completely clear on the dates but around the time, or just before my niece got married in 2011. I was in Mumbai at that time and I met with Sheena and Rahul. At that time, Sheena had said to me that she may be attending a wedding and so on and she told me that the information Indrani had given me was all wrong. And that Indrani had told me not to share this with anyone, but I am sharing it with you because I like you and Rahul is my boyfriend and that I cannot live with this lie. I found it clearly very, very difficult to digest that because all these years I had been told that she was my wife's sister.    Arnab: Why didn't you believe your own son? Was there trouble between Indrani and Sheena? What was the point of disagreement?    Peter: Between Indrani and Sheena there were disagreements from time to time, like any siblings have.    Arnab: What were the disagreements about?    Peter: I don't really know ...    Arnab: Is it true Indrani had problems with Sheena's relationship with Rahul?    Peter: Of course, Indrani had problems with Sheena's relationship with Rahul because... Rahul wasn't working at that time. She felt Sheena could do better, settle down and lead a more stable life with somebody who had a career, etc. I have shared this information with Rahul numerous times.    Arnab: People would say you chose to not believe neither Sheena nor Rahul.    Peter: I don't know in your situation how you would react to that kind of an allegation but in my relationship with my wife, I believe in my wife 9.9 times out of 10. I would go as far as saying 10 times out of 10, unless I am proven or it is proven that she is wrong. She is my wife after all.    Arnab: Did you feel that Rahul and Sheena were telling you what they were because they resented your second marriage with Indrani?    Peter: Well, that was what Indrani had also responded to me by saying... look you know if you are choosing to believe your son who is in any case unhappy about the fact that you have got remarried and the best thing that he would feel would be if the marriage were to break up and that would make him happy, that would make his mother happy, it would certainly be an objective.    Arnab: You believe?    Peter: It's not beyond comprehension that an offspring would find (the) second marriage of a parent disagreeable.    Arnab: Where were you when this murder happened? And where was Indrani?    Peter: Well, let me firstly respond by saying that it's a murder charge and that Indrani from what I remember from the date was in Bombay and my daughter Vidhi and myself were in England and then in Rome.    Arnab: So it was planned that she would come to Mumbai? Why was she coming to Mumbai? What did she tell you?    Peter: I knew she was coming to Mumbai to meet with her brother Michail and that the two of them had worked out along with blessings from parents that they would make sure that Sheena was moved to Guwahati and from then the plan was that she could go overseas and study in the US.    Arnab: How can an educated adult doing a job be moved against their own will?    Peter: Look I don't know, to be honest with you, I did not get into the detail of that. I assumed that there was some level of collision between Sheena and Indrani and that Sheena was unhappy in her relationship with Rahul at that point. In fact if my memory is correct, there was an email shown to me by Indrani on a laptop screen that you know Sheena is looking to get out of that relationship and.    Arnab: Whose email?    Peter: I can't remember. I think it was an email from Sheena to indrani    Arnab: Why is it that a person like you or your entire family did not make any attempt to raise questions about how a person can disappear into thin air?    Peter: Well I don't think she ever disappeared into thin air.    Arnab: Didn't you find it suspicious that she would not speak to you, to Vidhi, to any other members of the family, that she was just incommunicado in today's world?    Peter: Look, it may look a little strange that she was incommunicado but when a family wants to kind of break down a particular relationship they are not happy with, they sometimes cut off communication lines between the people concerned and ask them to put their mobile away, switch off their Facebook, switch off social media....    Arnab: And be non-existent?    Peter: So as to limit contact.    Arnab: One of the things that is being spoken about is that the possible motive is property and money. Were there any conflicts over money between Indrani and Sheena? Any financial transactions involving Sheena?    Peter: Trust me, there was no financial issue. I never heard Sheena or Indrani squabble about money. Sheena's college fees was paid. Her PG charges and fees was paid and I never really heard there were any financial issues. With regard to property, none whatsoever... Look I had no contact with the family as such. I had never met Sheena's...Indrani's parents. I had only met Sheena and her brother Michail. So there was never a question of me having knowledge about what properties they owned, where those properties were, etc.    Arnab: Have there been any conversation about where Sheena is between you and other members of your family and Indrani? How did she react when that question was asked?    Peter: Look, the first time, the reaction was straightforward, in that she said she has gone to the US and she is going to living there and studying there.    Arnab: No, I meant did you ever confront Indrani with this information that your son had given you that Sheena was her daughter?    Peter: Of course I did and the reaction was to refute that.    Arnab: Was she touchy about it?    Peter: Yeah of course.    Arnab: Was she angry?    Peter: Of course. And when I raised it the second or third time, that anger stoked and very soon it was a subject which was taboo... We would never discuss either Sheena or Rahul or Sheena and Rahul together, because this would lead to a complete dramatic kind of an argument and complete breakdown of conversation between the three people in the home.    Arnab: Did Indrani tell you not to be in touch with Sheena?    Peter: Look it was a subject which had become a taboo. There was no question of me then on the quiet meeting with Sheena and talking to Sheena or talking to Rahul because the two were persona non-grata as far as Indrani was concerned.    Arnab: So there was a running family feud?    Peter: I don't know about a feud but they were persona non-grata to that extent. And therefore, for me to be want to be in contact or in conversation with my wife about somebody who was persona non-grata would only would've lead to further acrimonious situation.    Arnab: What would you say to all those people who say this makes Peter Mukherjea look very gullible. Probably he is hiding something.    Peter: No look, I think it's a fair assumption that people will consider I am gullible. But I can assure that I am not hiding anything.    Arnab: You believe your wife is the murderer?    Peter: Certainly not. It is impossible to believe she is the murderer, due to the 15 years and she's never indicated to me that she has gotten any murderous instinct in her character.||

The missing servant was apprehended from Etawah in Uttar Pradesh and Rs 3.7 lakh in cash found on him.    Shanti Chopra was bludgeoned to death with a bat after she found her domestic help stealing cash and jewellery from her almirah. Police said he thrashed her sons when they tried to stop him. Chopra, a widow, had been living with her two sons, both disabled. The role of the placement agency through which the help had been hired is also being investigated.      "Four teams led by ACP (Paharganj) Om Prakash and SHO (Paharganj) Rajender Kumar were formed. The boy had left with the dead woman's mobile phone. He was apprehended from Etawah railway station on basis of technical surveillance and local intelligence," said DCP (central) Parmaditya.    The juvenile offender, who is from Gumla district of Jharkhand, had taken a train to his native place after committing the crime. Police traced Chopra's mobile phone to a spot near New Delhi railway station. After going through the list of trains to Jharkhand, they boarded Magadh Express and Vaishali Express. Information was flashed to GRP and police at Tunda, Aligarh, Etawah, Kanpur and Allahabad to look out for the boy, said a senior police officer.    He was found sitting in Magadh Express at Etawah and was taken into custody. A sum of Rs 3.7 lakh as well as Chopra's phone have been seized from him. Police are also probing if he, himself, is a victim of human trafficking. Sleuths found the back door of the house locked from inside and the ventilator in the toilet open. It indicated that he had used it to leave the house and had escaped via the staircase of the adjacent building. The help has confessed to the crime.  ||NEW DELHI

The police have arrested the two killers and the father. The body was found dumped in a drain on June 28 this year in west Delhi's Sainik Enclave area.    The victim, Shameem Saifi (28), was allegedly strangled by two men, Mansoor Ahmad (39) and Anees Rana (29), who were hired by the father, Rohil Saifi. The case was blind for two months till cops detected suspicious calls between the supari killers and confronted them with evidence. The two men were arrested on Wednesday. They said the crime was planned by the victim's father, who was arrested on Thursday from his house. The police have seized a car used in the crime and two sim cards registered in the name of the victim.    The incident took place on the intervening night of June 27-28, when the two accused invited Shameem for a round of drinks at Rana's uncle's residence in Vikas Nagar area. "Shameem, who was a habitual drinker, accepted the offer, and the three left for the venue. Around midnight, when Shameem had fallen asleep, the two strangled him with a piece of cloth. After ensuring that he was dead, they carried the body in a Santro car and dumped it in a drain in Sainik Enclave," said Pushpendra Kumar, DCP west.    Police interrogated relatives, locals and associates of Shameem but couldn't get a breakthrough. Kumar said that Rana and Ahmad, who were known to Shameem's father, came under suspicion when their numbers were put on watch along with many others.      Saifi, who has four children, owns a timber and steel business. He is also deals in property and came to know Rana and Ahmad in the course of this business. Ahmad said Rohil had been planning to kill his son for the past one year and that he used to mentioned this to him every time Shameem assaulted him brutally.    "According to Saifi's statement, Shameem, the second eldest of his siblings, used to return home drunk and beat him regularly. He thought his son's behavior would change after marriage. However, his conduct towards his wife remained the same and she left him after filing a case against him with the Crime Against Women's cell. On May 9, Shameem returned from a hearing at the cell and urinated on his sleeping father's face. He also threatened to repeat the same with his mother and sisterRohil couldn't stand this humiliation any longer and decided to get his son killed," Kumar said.  ||NEW DELHI

The call came at a time when Mumbai police was still trying to confirm Sheena Bora's relationship with Indrani Mukherjea. The caller, said cops, had hinted that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, not sister. Though Meerut police have not received any written statement about this, officials here say they will "as of now" not try to trace the caller because it might create hurdles in the case. "TV reports have indicated that a call from Meerut has gone to Mumbai police regarding this case but no written statement from Mumbai police has come to us as of now. We are not trying to find the caller on our own," Ramit Sharma, deputy inspector general (DIG), Meerut range, told TOI on Thursday.||MEERUT
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Ambitious-people-dont-mind-hiding-a-fact-or-two-Shrinks/articleshow/48702748.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||Mumbai: There was widespread shock and disbelief since sordid details of Sheena Bora's murder unfolded and mother Indrani Mukerjea was accused of having killed her.  "This is horrible news to hear," said Dr Kersi Chavda, immediate past president of the Bombay Psychiatric Society. "Basically, people seem to have increasingly become intolerant. It is perhaps the disappearance of joint families that has led people to lose their tolerance and closeness," he said.  There are several theories about why Indrani allegedly killed her daughter, with her son Michail stating that he knows the reason for it.  "After reading the news development and articles, it would seem the accused was ambitious and highly motivated," said Dr Vishal Sawant, head of psychiatry at BMC-run Cooper Hospital in Juhu. People "driven" by ambition wouldn't think much of hiding a fact or two to get ahead in the rat race. "Ambitious people believe they have achieved a lot at some cost. They view their 'sacrifice' as an achievement that they cannot stand to lose it all," said Dr Sawant. When aggressively ambitious people feel they are about to lose all that they worked for, there could be a lot of desperation and rage, said the doctor.  Another doctor who didn't wish to be identified said, "The circumstances of the case make it seem like a pre-mediated murder. This doesn't seem like rage at work. Clearly, no normal person would behave like this."  Consulting psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty blames the chronic emotional blinding in society for the rise in crime against family members. "There is a lot of anonymity in this new world we live in. it is characterized by poor social and emotional bonding between people. In such an environment, people lack reason and emotional blinding can become a chronic thing."  Earlier this month, Indians were shocked to read about a Pune mother who battered her physically challenged son to death. Now, a similar story seems to be playing out as Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria gave out details of the murder at a press conference on Wednesday evening.  "In the Indian society, killing daughters is not new. Female infanticide is a known entity here. How can a mother who carries a child around for nine months, kill her after birth just because she is a girl?" asked Dr Chavda.  ||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Sheena-docu-Michail-add-to-mystery/articleshow/48701752.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||GUWAHATI: The persistent silence of Michail, Sheena's younger brother, on the identity of their biological father and the manner in which his sister's birth certificate was registered have raised a number of unanswered questions.    Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target.

Two days after his mother Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Mikhail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed what he gave the police was enough to prove Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora, who are actually Indrani's parents, as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. However, many questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter. In many cases in India involving single mothers, grandparents are known to put in their names as father and mother.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:08 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

They alleged some senior BJP leaders were allegedly involved in the massacres of some 144 dalit men, women and children in Bihar and that PM has so far neither spoken against them and their accomplices nor taken any action against them.    In a letter addressed to the PM, they said, "We are deeply shocked by the recent horrifying revelations (by a news portal) about the massacres of dalit and other oppressed-caste people in Bihar and are writing to you to express our dismay that you have so far not spoken out against the killers and their accomplices.    Spokespersons of these organizations urged Modi to act because his "lack of action on this issue gives the shocking message that lives of dalits and oppressed do not matter in India". They urged him to act urgently to ensure that the self-confessed killers are brought to justice and all the politicians, including senior BJP politicians, are dismissed from their posts, arrested and charged.    Quoting the news portal, they said Ranvir Sena, the upper caste landlords' army in Bihar, perpetrated a number of major massacres of dalits and oppressed caste people, including at Bathani Tola, Laxmanpur Bathe, Shankarbigha, Miyanpur and Ekwari, between 1994 and 2000, murdering some 144 men, women and children simply for demanding basic rights and dignity.    The Amir Das Commission, which was set up in 1997 after the Laxmanpur Bathe killings, to investigate these massacres was disbanded in 2005 by the Nitish government, then in alliance with the BJP, to appease and shield his erstwhile BJP allies, they alleged.    The signatories include Meena Varma (Dalit Solidarity Network), Arun Kumar (Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organization, UK), Davinder Prasad (Caste Watch, UK) Ramesh Klair (Sri Guru Ravidass Global Organisation for Human Rights), Ravi Kumar (Anti-Caste Discrimination Alliance), Amrit Wilson (South Asia Solidarity Group).    ||PATNA

She was booked in 2012.     The prosecution found that the woman, married to Bareilly resident Babu Ram, had three sons, nine-year-old Abhishek, seven-year-old Guddu, and five-year-old Suraj. After the birth of their third son, the prosecution said, the couple fell out with each other and frequently squabbled.     The woman then returned to her parents' house in Civil Lines, Moradabad, from the home of her husband in Bareilly. She took along her three sons. While at her parents' home, she fell in love with a man called Prateek Rastogi. She however, never told her boyfriend that she had been married earlier and was mother to three sons.     The prosecution said that on the evening of September 18, 2012, the woman got her children to drink milk in which she had mixed some poisonous substance. She then left her home, to abscond with her boyfriend to Sambhal district.     The Civil Lines police station registered a case of murder. In the course of investigations, it was found that the three children had been poisoned. The role of the missing mother was suspected. Police also interrogated the woman's lover, who revealed all and turned prosecution witness.     Prosecution officer Mohammad Akram Khan said the woman's boyfriend onfessed that she had killed her children so she could be free to marry. Rastogi, the prosecution lawyer said, had no knowledge that his lover was the mother of three sons, and feared that if she could kill her own sons, she would not stop short of killing him.     ||MORADABAD

Not only did the cops fail to register a murder case and send the body for a post-mortem and various scientific tests, they disposed of the body after only making a dairy entry. As per standard procedure, the police should have preserved the body in some government hospital/ morgue so that some claimant could come forward and should have registered a murder or accidental death report (ADR), but in this case police buried the body in the jungle without carrying out any scientific test.     A high-level inquiry has been ordered by the state director general of police to find out who the officer in-charge of the police station was at that time. The body was found on May 23, 2012. Sources said that the only good thing the police did was that they collected samples and made a small diary entry before disposing of the body. "The police have neither registered a murder nor ADR," said a senior police officer. However, the Khar police on Tuesday collected the reference number of the dairy entry and visited JJ hospital and asked them to hand over the forensic reports of the bones that the Raigad police had sent them. "We will now carry out a DNA test of Indrani, her parents and Michail to establish that the body was of indeed that of Sheena and this will be an important piece of evidence," said an official from Khar police station.     When asked whether any departmental inquiry will be initiated against the concerned Raigad police officers for botching up the case, Raigad SP, Suez Haque, said that Mumbai joint CP (law and order) Deven Bharti should be contacted regarding this.     Konkan IG Prashant Burde said, "I have not ordered any probe in the murder case of Sheena Bora as the Mumbai police is concerned with it. I have not yet received official papers pertaining to the case and hence cannot comment. But the Raigad police will assist the Mumbai police in their investigation as and when they seek help."     Sameer Patil (32), sarpanch of Gagode village for the past seven years, said, "This is the first time that a woman's body was found in the ravines near our village. As an unbearable stench was emanating from the area, some locals informed the police after which they climbed down the ravine and found a burnt suitcase with a partially charred woman's body. The area was cordoned off by the police for two days and the villagers were prevented from entering the forest to cut firewood."     ||MUMBAI/RAIGAD

The investigating officer in the case Bhawarkuan police station in-charge Rajendara Soni ruled out possibility of Kavita's extramarital affair and role of a drunkard with whom she had a tiff last month.     "Our team recreated the crime scene. CCTV footage of the nearby electronic shop was observed. We have formed various teams of officials for the case and they are investigating the case. The culprits will be arrested soon," DIG Santosh Kumar Singh told media persons here.     Forensic expert Sudhir Sharma denied claims that the woman was raped before murder. However, he said that she was attacked with a knife on her head and chest.     "Examination could not reveal the possibility of rape with the woman. She was attacked with a knife before the accused dismembered her body. There was no use of electric cutter," said Sharma.     Meanwhile, demanding swift action to nab the accused, the family members and locals took out a candle light march at Bengali square in the evening.     Holding placards and raising slogans, large number of people condemned the heinous crime and sought early arrest of the accused. Many city residents who did not know the family personally also turned up at the candle light march.     "Though I don't know the family personally, Kavita's demise is very sad for the city.

The call came at a time when Mumbai police was still trying to confirm whether Sheena Bora was the daughter or sister of Indrani Mukherjea. The caller, cops said, had hinted that Sheena was indeed Indrani's daughter, not sister. Though no written statement about this has been received by Meerut Police, officials here say they will "as of now" not try to trace the caller because it might create hurdles in the already twisted murder mystery.     "TV reports have indicated that a call from Meerut has gone to Mumbai Police regarding this case but no written statement from Mumbai Police has come to us as of now. We are not trying to find the caller on our own," said Ramit Sharma, deputy inspector general (DIG), Meerut range, talking to TOI on Thursday.     If the call from Meerut is not a hoax, it might open a new angle to the already twisted murder story. Ever since Sheena went missing in 2012, Indrani had maintained that she was studying abroad. Moreover, her current husband Peter claims that he discovered that Sheena was her daughter and not sister only after she confessed it to the police.     "If we receive any notice from Mumbai Police to help them to trace the caller, we will help them in every possible manner. But as of now, we are keeping away from the case," said Sharma.     ||MEERUT

In 2011, Shabnam's elder son Rahul brought Sheena (daughter of Indrani Mukherjea) to seek approval from her and other members of the family for their wedding.    The entire family â€” comprising Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema â€” were bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards elderly people, which they found rare in today's world. Impressed by her, the family gave "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, according to Shaleen. The family expected the wedding to take place within a few months.    Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen told TOI that Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. "My interaction with her was barely for five to seven minutes. She was good looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding," he added.    Shaleen came to know about Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he added.    A model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand had expired in April, and they had come to pay their tributes but we did not interact much."    Though Shabnam's farm "Gul-e-Shabnam" and Shaleen's residence "Shankar Sadan" are barely at a distance of 200 metres in Badripur, interaction between them is rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.    "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.    On his relations with Rahul, Shaleen said that he had not interacted with him for years. "Even when we came face-to-face, there were not much talk between us. All I know about him is that he had studied for some time in England, and spends most of his time in London, Mumbai and Dehradun. Shabnam's younger son Robin is perhaps working in England but I don't have much information about Rahul," he added.    Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai Police in Dehradun, saying, "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue." Meanwhile, the staff at Shabnam's residence claimed that she was out-of-station but were unaware of her location.    'An arranged marriage'    In a brief interaction with media, Shabnam's mother Seema Singh said that her daughter had an arranged marriage with Peter Mukherjea on September 9, 1975.    "Initially, things went well between the two but after the birth of Rahul, their relations were strained," she said, adding that thereafter, Shabnam spend most of her time in London.    "She later built her home on our ancestral land in Badripur and started living here," she said.    According to Seema, the family members made several efforts to repair the marriage but it didn't work.||DEHRADUN

But bizarre as it may sound, fact is that this is a case of life imitating fiction rather than fiction imitating life," Bhatt said in a statement.The story that Bhatt has penned was completed in May and will be produced by Dhaval Jayantilal Gada. It is a story of crime and passion, soaked in blood, revolving around a mother and daughter.While Bhatt refuses to get into details, he says it plays itself out in a media space with characters intoxicated by fame and power, flush with money and caught in multi-partner, bi-sexual relationships."The story grew out of my imagination. I never imagined that it could be unfolding for real in a high rise in our backyard where the rich and powerful reside. The coincidence between a pure work of fiction and real life staggers me, it makes me shudder," he said.Now, with the Indrani-Sheena story grabbing headlines, will some of their real life story creep into his reel-life story?Bhatt said: "No, my work is done. I only wrote this story for my protege. The film should roll in December. I never imagined that it would explode for real as the mother of all crime stories."||MUMBAI

Rahul, Mukerjea's son from his first marriage, was in a relationship with Sheena, which Peter said Indrani disapproved of. Police suspect the case to be one of honour killing.Mukerjea told Times Now that sometime around 2011, "Sheena had told me... Indrani has given you wrong information. I am not her sister, I am actually her daughter." However, he chose not to believe her but his wife who strongly refuted any such suggestion, he said.Mukerjea had on Wednesday said he was "dumbstruck by the level of criminality" in the case. However, asked on Thursday if he believed his wife was the murderer, he said, "Certainly not" and added that he believed "a person is innocent until proven guilty."Mukerjea, at the same time, admitted that there were "disagreements from time to time" between Indrani and Sheena and though he did not know what they were about, he knew that Indrani "had problems with Sheena's relationship with Rahul".Asked if Sheena was a source of conflict in the family, Peter said, "Not Sheena, but the relationship (with Rahul) was the cause of conflict."In April 2012, the month in which Sheena was killed, Mukerjea said he was abroad but knew Indrani was "coming to Mumbai to meet with her brother Michail and the two of them had worked out... that they would make sure Sheena was moved to Guwahati and from then the plan was that she could go overseas and study in the US."Asked why, after Indrani told him that Sheena had moved to the US, he had not made any attempt to raise questions about how a person could disappear into thin air, Mukerjea replied, "I don't think she ever disappeared into thin air."Police are probing if a possible property and money dispute was behind the murder. Mukerjea said there were no financial or property issues between Indrani and Sheena.||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:15 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Additional sessions judge Reetesh Singh convicted Akshay Kumar Singh, Mukesh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma for the offences under various sections of the IPC, including sections 395 (dacoity) and 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine a person).     "Vide separate order pronounced today, the accused persons are convicted in all the sections for which charges were framed against them. Put up the matter for arguments on sentence on September 2," the judge said.     All the four convicts were present in the court at the time of pronouncement of judgement.     Six persons, including a juvenile, had beaten up and robbed a carpenter before raping and brutally assaulting a 23-year-old girl in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, 2012. The victim had died in a Singapore hospital on December 29, 2012.     Mukesh, Vinay, Pawan and Akshay were awarded death penalty by trial court in the gang rape and murder case which was later confirmed by Delhi high court. Their appeals are pending before the Supreme Court.     Accused Ram Singh had allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail on March 11, 2013. The juvenile was facing proceedings in the gangrape and murder case before Juvenile Justice Board which sentenced him to three years detention in reformation home. Proceedings against Ram Singh were abated following his death.     The court had on July 15, 2013 framed charges against the four accused after they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.     Apart from dacoity and kidnapping, the court had also framed charges against them for the offences punishable under sections 342 (wrongfully confining any person), 394(person voluntarily causing hurt in committing or attempting to commit robbery), 412 (dishonestly receiving stolen property knowing that it was obtained by dacoity) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.     ||NEW DELHI

Chief judicial magistrate, Alipore court, Rajesh Chakraborty accepted the remand prayer of Mumbai Police and directed it to produce him before a designated Mumbai court by September 1.     The judge rejected the bail prayer of Khanna, who claimed he was innocent.     Indrani, wife of former Star India CEO Peter Mukherjea, was arrested by the Mumbai Police on Tuesday following leads by her driver, who was also taken into custody, in connection with the disappearance and murder of Sheena.     The Mumbai Police had arrested Khanna on Wednesday. Sheena was stated to be Indrani's daughter from an earlier marriage.     Khanna, a resident of upmarket Hastings Road area here, was arrested from his friend's flat at Alipore.     Seeking his bail, Khanna's counsel Salim Rehman submitted he was in Mumbai on April 24, 2012, the fateful day when Sheena was killed and her body disposed off at Pen in Raigad district of Maharashtra, but claimed he was not involved in the crime.     He said Khanna had gone to meet Vidhie, his daughter from his marriage with Indrani, but had returned the next day after failing to meet her.     Khanna's counsel submitted he would cooperate with the investigation and would not abscond if granted bail.     Appearing for the Mumbai Police, public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal opposed the bail plea and prayed for a seven-day transit remand.     Ghosal claimed before the court that Khanna was directly involved in the crime and had been named by the driver of Indrani, another accused in the intriguing case.||KOLKATA

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/DNA-report-everybody-forgot-is-what-nailed-Indrani-Mukerjeas-lies/articleshow/48694412.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:21 IST 2015||MUMBAI: Weeks before they picked up Indrani, the cops had figured out that a body found in Pen in 2012 was that of Sheena, her daughter, who she would always introduce as her step-sister.A DNA report gathering dust at the Kalina Forensic Lab for nearly three years has turned out to be Mumbai police's most valuable evidence in the sensational Sheena Bora murder case, which on Tuesday evening led to the arrest of top TV honcho Peter Mukerjea's wife Indrani.It was based on this report that Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria asked Indrani that one question that unravelled a complex web of lies she had built around her life - was Sheena her step-sister, as everybody around her, including her husband, was made to believe, or her daughter? Indrani knew her game was up.The DNA report, which many believed did not exist, was of a body found half burnt in the jungles of Pen in Raigad district on May 23, 2012. Weeks before they picked up Indrani, the cops had figured out that the body was that of Sheena. They had a DNA match. They also had the entire story of how she was killed from Indrani's trusted driver Shyamvar Rai, who had spilled the beans after his arrest in an unconnected case - illicit purchase of a gun. He too was arrested on Tuesday, while the third accused, Indrani's exhusband Sanjeev Khanna, was arrested on Wednesday in Kolkata.The cops now know that Indrani, Khanna, and Rai picked up Sheena on April 24, 2012 from her apartment in Khar, which she shared with Peter Mukerjea's son from his first marriage, Rahul. According to police sources, Khanna throttled Sheena with her dupatta in the car. The three then drove down to the family's apartment in Worli and parked the car in the garage with the body. The next day, all three drove deep into a forested area in Pen, disfigured the body by smashing it with rocks, and set it on fire.The body was dumped so deep in the jungle that it was first spotted by a passerby only a month later. Since there was no missing complaint and the body was badly decomposed, the Pen police filed an accidental death report and buried the body. They did send a sample for DNA testing, but forgot all about it thereafter. Till of course, the Mumbai police came calling.Police inspector Suresh Mirge, who investigated the case in Pen in 2012, confirmed that his team had sent a sample for DNA tests but the results were never collected. "Only an accidental death report was filed since there was no complaint. DNA tests results take time. I assume the team just lost track of the case," he said.Police sources said Indrani hid her relationship with Sheena and her brother Mikhail because she felt it could hit her social standing. The motive for killing Sheena, cops said, could be Indrani's disapproval of Sheena's relationship with Rahul. Days after Sheena was killed, Indrani told Peter Mukerjea that she had packed her off to the US.||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:21 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:21 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:21 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:21 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU

The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:21 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:21 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/Lessons-from-the-murders-of-TV-journalists-in-the-Virginia-shooting/articleshow/48693537.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||The slaying of two journalists Wednesday as they broadcast live to a television audience in Virginia is still seared on our screens and our minds, but it's a moment not only to mourn but also to learn lessons.The horror isn't just one macabre double-murder, but the unrelenting toll of gun violence that claims one life every 16 minutes on average in the United States. Three quick data points:- More Americans die in gun homicides and suicides every six months than have died in the last 25 years in every terrorist attack and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.- More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in US history.- American children are 14 times as likely to die from guns as children in other developed countries, according to David Hemenway, a Harvard professor and author of an excellent book on firearm safety.Bryce Williams, as the Virginia killer was known to viewers when he worked as a broadcaster, apparently obtained the gun used to murder his former co-workers Alison Parker and Adam Ward in response to the June massacre in a South Carolina church - an example of how gun violence begets gun violence. Williams may have been mentally disturbed, given that he videotaped Wednesday's killings and then posted them on Facebook."I've been a human powder keg for a while . just waiting to go BOOM!!!!," Williams reportedly wrote in a lengthy fax sent to ABC News after the killings.Whether or not Williams was insane, our policies on guns are demented - not least in that we don't even have universal background checks to keep weapons out of the hands of people waiting to go boom.The lesson from the ongoing carnage is not that we need a modern prohibition (that would raise constitutional issues and be impossible politically), but that we should address gun deaths as a public health crisis. To protect the public, we regulate toys and mutual funds, ladders and swimming pools. Shouldn't we regulate guns as seriously as we regulate toys?The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has seven pages of regulations concerning ladders, which are involved in 300 deaths in America annually. Yet the federal government doesn't make what I would call a serious effort to regulate guns, which are involved in the deaths of more than 33,000 people in America annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (that includes suicides, murders and accidents).Gun proponents often say things to me like: What about cars? They kill, too, but we don't try to ban them!Cars are actually the best example of the public health approach that we should apply to guns. Over the decades, we have systematically taken steps to make cars safer: We adopted seatbelts and air bags, limited licenses for teenage drivers, cracked down on drunken driving and established roundabouts and better crosswalks, auto safety inspections and rules about texting while driving.This approach has been stunningly successful. By my calculations, if we had the same auto fatality rate as in 1921, we would have 715,000 Americans dying annually from cars. We have reduced the fatality rate by more than 95 percent.Yet in the case of firearms, the gun lobby (enabled by craven politicians) has for years tried to block even research on how to reduce gun deaths. The gun industry made a childproof gun back in the 19th century but today has ferociously resisted "smart guns." If someone steals an iPhone, it requires a PIN; guns don't.We're not going to eliminate gun deaths in America. But a serious effort might reduce gun deaths by, say, one-third, and that would be 11,000 lives saved a year.The United States is an outlier, both in our lack of serious policies toward guns and in our mortality rates. Hemenway calculates that the US firearm homicide rate is seven times that of the next country in the rich world on the list, Canada, and 600 times higher than that of South Korea.We need universal background checks with more rigorous screening, limits on gun purchases to one a month to reduce trafficking, safe storage requirements, serial number markings that are more difficult to obliterate, waiting periods to buy a handgun - and more research on what steps would actually save lives. If the federal government won't act, states should lead.||

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sheena-Bora-murder-case-Police-probe-honour-killing-angle/articleshow/48692654.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||MUMBAI: Investigators in the sensational Sheena Bora murder case are not ruling out the "honour killing" angle after it came to light that both Peter Mukerjea and main accused Indrani allegedly disapproved of the "relationship" between his son Rahul and the victim. According to police, Sheena and media baron Peter's son from an earlier marriage, Rahul, were dating for over a year which their family did not like."Although the motive behind the murder still remains a mystery, we are probing all the angles as we strongly suspect honour killing in this case," said a police inspector requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, Indrani Mukerjea's former husband Sanjeev Khanna, who was arrested from Kolkata on Wednesday, will be produced in a court here today, police said.Khanna, a resident of Hastings Road area in Kolkata, was arrested from his friend's flat in Alipore for his alleged involvement in the murder.Also, police are trying to ascertain whether Sheena had herself emailed her resignation to Mumbai Metro in 2012, the year she was killed, the inspector said.Sheena was kidnapped from outside the National College in western suburbs. She came here from Assam in 1990s along with Indrani and completed BA Economics from St Xavier's College.In June 2011, she got a job with Reliance Mumbai Metro but suddenly stopped coming to duty after some time, police said. In the same year, her Facebook account was deactivated.Police had unearthed remains of a decomposed body three years ago after villagers at Gagode in Pen tehsil complained of foul odour emanating from the area.According to Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria, the victim was strangulated to death and her body set afire after pouring petrol. The murder took place on 24 April, 2012 and the body was found by Raigad police on May 23, he said.Maria also said that Khanna is an accused in the case.Police also claimed that the former Star India CEO's wife Indrani was present at the site in Raigad district where Sheena was killed.As investigators dug deeper into the mystery of the death of the 24-year-old, a complex web of lies and relationships unravelled and it emerged that Sheena was Indrani's daughter and not sister as maintained earlier.The victim is stated to be Indrani's daughter from an earlier marriage with one Siddharth Das.Intriguing claims also came to light that 43-year-old Indrani had introduced her daughter and son to people as sister and brother. After the murder, she is also said to have claimed that Sheena had gone to the US for higher studies.Peter Mukerjea said he had believed that the victim was Indrani's sister and not her daughter while accused's son Mikhail said Sheena was the daughter and not the sister of Indrani."I have no doubt my mother Indrani killed my sister Sheena Bora," he said yesterday. He claimed to know the "exact reason" but said that he would not reveal it until his mother confesses to it.Mikhail said he had not heard from his sister since February 2012 and whenever he inquired about her with his mother she used to say Sheena was in the US.He said Sheena had gone to Mumbai alone since she was doing a job there.Peter said he would cooperate with investigators in the probe. "I have never experienced anything like this before. The news I am getting, the kind of crime that has been committed, I would have never expected."Whatever help, information, police need, I am happy to help them with that. I would be absolutely clear and straight with them and cooperate," he said yesterday.Peter said he was unaware that Sheena went missing."(Sheena's disappearance) is something I am finding out now. I was told that Sheena has gone to the US. I am not on Facebook, but I was shown these pictures of Los Angeles or wherever she was. I didn't have her contact number.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/Villagers-try-to-burn-family-alive-after-womans-death/articleshow/48688256.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||RANCHI: A group of villagers, on Wednesday, held a family hostage and tried to burn them alive accusing its members of murdering their daughter-in-law the previous night.    The residents of Siladaun village in Tupudana block, some 20 km from Ranchi, locked Jairam Mahto and his four family members inside their one-storey house and set it on fire, accusing the family of torturing their daughter-in-law Manju Devi (28) to death on Tuesday night. However, none was hurt as police stepped in to avert any casualty.    According to the Tupudana police station, the incident happened around 9 am when Manju Devi's body was found from a clearing adjoining the house. After the recovery, a team of three policemen went there only to be met with resistance from the villagers who refused to hand over the body for postmortem.    "The villagers refused to budge and gheraoed the house of the accused," Tupudana officer in-charge Amardeep said. The furious mob then locked the family in their concrete house and set it ablaze using kerosene. The police then arrived with reinforcements and resorted to a mild lathicharge before rescuing the family.    According to locals, Mahto and his family regularly tortured 28-year-old Manju. Manju was undergoing torture since the death of her husband and Mahto's eldest son Rajeev six months ago. On Tuesday evening, the victim had narrated her torture to a few women in the village and the villagers had called for a meeting with her in-laws on Wednesday. However, before the meeting could be held, she was killed on Tuesday night. "They lost temper after Manju's body was found," Hatia DSP Radha Prem Kishore said.    While the Hatia police waited for the postmortem report, the villagers remained certain that the victim died of asphyxiation. Mahto and his wife Parvati were also accused of foul play in their elder son's death, who the locals claimed died of poisoning. Police said the victim's only brother could not be contacted .    The accused were arrested and taken into police custody in the evening. "Further course of investigation will be done accordingly," Kishore said.    ||RANCHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-killed-daughter-not-sister-Police/articleshow/48690500.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||The case involving the arrest of Indrani Mukerjea (43), the high-profile co-founder of a broadcast company, for the murder of Sheena Bora in 2012 took a bizarre twist on Wednesday as it emerged that the murder victim was not Indrani's sister but her own daughter.     Adding to the sordid saga was the arrest of Indrani's exhusband Sanjeev Khanna and her driver Shyam Rai by Mumbai police for strangling Bora and disposing of the body in the forests of Raigad.     Indrani was arrested on Tuesday after Rai, arrested in an illegal arms case, spilled the beans on the murder that had not been cracked for three years. Indrani had all along maintained, even to her third husband Peter Mukerjea, ear lier CEO of Star India and promoter of INX Media, that Sheena was her sister and had moved to the US in April 2012.     Police commissioner Rakesh Maria said Indrani had confessed on Wednesday that Sheena was actually her daughter from her first marriage in Guwahati and that she had killed her with the help of her second husband, Khanna.     Police suspect it to be an `honour killing'. They say Indrani had serious problems with Sheena's relationship with her step-brother Rahul, Mukerjea's son from an earlier marriage. The two were planning to marry , cops said.     Police also say there could be a financial motive linked to proceeds from the TV channel where the Mukerjeas were the power couple.     The third theory they are examining is whether Sheena was blackmailing Indrani by threatening to reveal to Peter Mukerjea that she was her daughter and not her sister.     Police sources said that after killing Sheena, Indrani and Khanna had also planned to kill Michail, Sheena's brother and Indrani's second child from her first marriage, in order to garner his property. Khanna's motive for involvement, according to the police, was that he wanted his own daughter from Indrani, Vidhie, to get Sheena's share of the mother's property . Khanna will be produced in court on Thursday .     Rahul, who arrived in Mumbai late on Wednesday, was being grilled by Khar police at the time of going to press. He had dropped Sheena outside National College in Bandra on April 24, 2012 from where Indrani and Khanna picked her up in their car before strangling her.     Rai told police that Indrani had asked Sheena to meet her outside National College under the pretext of discussing some important issue."Indrani insisted over the phone that she come alone.After Rahul dropped Sheena at the spot and left, Sheena saw Khanna sitting on the rear seat of Indrani's car and refused to get in. But Indrani pulled Sheena inside and the car took off, with Rai driving," a police officer said.     On the way , while Khanna caught her hands and legs, Indrani strangled her. "The trio took her body to a remote place in Pen and used petrol to burn the body so she could not be recognized," said Maria, who was instrumental in cracking the case and who himself interrogated Indrani on Wednesday . This case too would have gone undetected like a few other sensational murders including that of 58-year-old Lalita Pinge in Shivaji Park in 2007, had Maria not asked inspector Dinesh Kadam to act on the tipoff that Indrani could be behind the mysterious disappearance of her sister Sheena.     Police have now called for the call detail reports (CDRs) of Indrani, Khanna, Rai, Sheena and Rahul. A former editor and columnist is also likely to be called in for questioning as he was in touch with Indrani.Police said that after Sheena went missing, Rahul tried to call her on her cell phone but it was switched off. After wait ing for two days, he went to Khar police station and tried to lodge a missing person's complaint as Sheena was a Khar resident. Khar police, however, did not take any notice, after which Rahul approached Worli police as Indrani stayed in Worli. The Worli police went to Indrani's house, where the latter told them that Sheena had left for the US "for her future," and the police believed her. The next day , Rahul got several text messages from Sheena's cell number stating that she wanted to break off the relationship with him as she was shifting to the US. Rahul tried to approach her again but could not get in touch with her.     Maria is said to be upset with Khar police who did not take Rahul's complaint seriously and also with two senior police officials of the region who were not convinced about information on the murder until Maria called them and asked them to supervise the investigation.     Peter Mukerjea told the police and media on Wednesday that he had never known that Indrani had a second husband. "She told me Sanjeev Khanna was her first husband and I believed her. I don't know anything about her marriage to any other person. Indrani and Khanna used to talk, but I never bothered to find out what went on between them. I am shocked. When, two years ago, somebody told me Sheena was her daughter and not her sister, I thought it was rubbish and believed Indrani," he said.     The identity of Indrani's first husband is being speculated upon, and cops are also examining a theory that she had one more relationship before that and whether that ended in marriage or not.     Meanwhile, a team of police officers on Wednesday reached Pen and collected the copy of the panchnama and pictures of the body . "We have communicated with SP Suhez Haq who had told us that on May 23, 2012, police had indeed found the decomposed body of a woman which was beyond recognition. We are in the process of gathering evidence," said Deven Bharti, joint commissioner of police (law and order). Sheena had been working for Metro One in 2012. A MMOPL spokesperson said on Wednesday that she had "joined Mumbai Metro as an assistant manager on 20th June, 2011. She took leave of absence on 24th April, 2012 and while she was on leave, she sent in her written resignation."     (With inputs from V Narayan)                         ||

The murder took place on April 24, 2012 and the body was found by Raigad police on May 23, 2012.The Khar police stumbled on the murder mystery when they arrested Mukerjea's driver Rai, acting on a tip-off, who was found in possession of 7.62mm loaded pistol on August 21. Rai took the investigators to the spot where they dumped Sheena's body. The local police at Raigad found her skeletal body on May 23, 2012. However there was no missing case was registered anywhere and the matter remained untraced."Inquiries with the local police at Raigad confirmed Rai's confession. Total three arrest has been made in the case. Indrani has confessed that Sheena was her daughter," Mumbai Commissioner of Police Rakesh Maria said."There was no missing complaint registered with the police. The case has been registered on August 21 after Rai's arrest for illegal possession of arms. Indrani's former husband Khanna will be brought to Mumbai after completing the legal formalities in Kolkata," Maria said.The motive of the murder still remains a mystery though Indrani's son Mikhail claimed he knew the real reason but would not disclose it now.Taking the investigation beyond the state, Mumbai Police arrested former husband of Indrani, Sanjeev Khanna, in connection with the case in Kolkata. Sheena is stated to be Indrani's daughter from an earlier marriage with one Siddharth Das.TV grab.Khanna, a resident of Hastings Road area in Kolkata, was arrested from his friend's flat in Alipore for his alleged involvement in the murder, Kolkata Police joint CP (crime) Pallab Kanti Ghosh said.A shocked Peter Mukherjea said he had believed that the deceased was Indrani's sister and not her daughter, while Mikhail said Sheena was the daughter and not the sister of Indrani."I have no doubt my mother Indrani killed my sister Sheena Bora," he said, claiming to know the "exact reason" but would not reveal it until his mother confesses to it.His statement came amid reports that Sheena and Peter's son Rahul through his earlier marriage had been dating each other and Indrani was against it.Intriguing claims came to light that Indrani had introduced her daughter and son to people as sister and brother. After the murder, she is also said to have claimed that Sheena had gone to the US for higher studies.Indrani was arrested by Khar Police last night over her alleged role in Sheena's murder.Peter said he would cooperate with investigators in the probe. "I have never experienced anything like this before. The news I am getting, the kind of crime that has been committed, I would have never expected."Whatever help, information, police need, I am happy to help them with that. I would be absolutely clear and straight with them and cooperate," he said."I don't understand at all with regard to my wife ... Sheena Bora is her sister, I believed all these years, and now I am being told that she was her daughter. Whom I thought was her brother, is now her son from an earlier marriage, which I was not aware of. I was aware of one marriage and not so many others. So, now there are number of things that are appearing to me which are completely new to me," Peter said.||MUMBAI

The cop escaped unhurt and a case of attempt to murder against the unidentified person was registered on Wednesday.    The shooting happened around 5.15pm, when constable Rajesh Kumar (25) was on patrolling duty near the shopping mall on Arjun Marg. Kumar noticed a man in a blue shirt, riding a Pulsar motorcycle that had a Delhi registration number. The man was roving around women in suspicious manner. Suspecting something devious, Kumar signaled the biker to stop. The man, however, tried to flee the spot.    Kumar, along with another constable Balwan Singh, first cordoned off the area and then tried to apprehend the man. Just when Kumar was about to get hold of the biker, he was shot at. The bullet missed Kumar and the biker managed to escape.    Later, a bullet shell of a 7.6mm pistol was recovered from the spot. The bike's registration number could not be noted amid the commotion. "He was on a road that had only one exit point. I had positioned myself strategically. The biker, however, threatened me with his weapon. I continued to follow him, but he opened fire," constable Kumar told TOI.    "The man was wearing a helmet and there are no CCTV cameras installed in the market. It is difficult to identify the accused. We, however, have registered a case and will seek the help of our informants in nabbing him," ACP (crime) Rajesh Kumar said.    A case has been lodged at DLF I police station under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 307 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act.  ||GURGAON

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU

From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU

From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:27 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Her family accused railway employee Neel Nibaran Lahkar of murdering her. Sweety's relatives alleged that Lahkar, whom she met during a train journey, would often come to the model's apartment unannounced and express his love for her.    The deceased's sister said Lahkar had come to the apartment on Tuesday night and was involved in a heated argument with Sweety. "They were talking in a different room. I went to sleep soon afterwards. In the morning, when I went to wake Sweety, she was dead. Security guards at the apartment said Lahkar had left after 2 am," she said.    Preliminary investigation hinted at the possibility of strangulation. Police, who sent her body for autopsy, said it bore injury marks.    Sweety's was a popular face in the city. She acted in advertisements for the NRC update issued by the state government and was a calender girl for many companies. She had a child who lives with her husband in Golaghat district.  ||GUWAHATI

Tragedy had stuck the sterilisation camps, organised by the health department, at Sakri and at Gaurella, Pendra and Marwahi, all in Bilaspur district. The findings of the judicial commission are mostly on the anticipated lines as state government had subsequently cracked down on drug manufacturing companies after some antibiotics were found substandard and also on doctors who had conducted the surgeries. While 13 women had died, 122 others were left ailing after the botched surgeries.     The main doctor at the camp, Dr RK Gupta had in fact conducted 83 sterilisation operations at the Takhtpur health camp within a short span of three and half hours, spending just two and half minutes on each surgery. Dr Gupta was subsequently arrested.     Initial test reports conducted on the antibiotics, Ciprocin, distributed at the camp, had confirmed presence of rat poison (Zinc Phosphide). The police had subsequently booked the directors of Mahawar Pharmaceutical and Kavita Pharma Company under charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Sec 304 IPC). Interestingly, lab reports from other labs in Delhi and Mumbai had concluded that while the medicines were substandard, there was no poison in it.     The judicial commission report, which was taken up at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, will now be tabled in Vidhan Sabha in the next session. The cabinet has decided that stringent disciplinary action, as applicable under the law, would be taken against concerned officials of the health and family welfare department and the drug manufacturers and suppliers of substandard and poison contaminated medicines (Ciprocin 500 and ibrufen 400) distributed in the sterilization camps.     The cabinet has also accepted all the recommendation of the commission regarding precautions that need to be taken in order to prevent such tragedies in future.||RAIPUR

Purnima was arrested after it came to light that she had destroyed Shenoy's debit cards which Gadhve had used to withdraw Rs 2.53 lakh, after he was arrested.     Her involvement came to light during Gadhve's interrogation, after he was handed over to the Paud police station by the Yerawada police, as the murder has been registered in Paud. The murder had taken place in Pirangut ghat when Gadhve (23) of Ahmednagar and his accomplice Vishal Kale (21) of Ashoknagar killed Shenoy (41) who lived alone. The trio had downed a few drinks at a hotel near Mandai, in Shukrawar Peth a few hours before the murder.     Gadhve's month-old friendship with Shenoy, who used to travel frequently in his autorickshaw to and from his office in Yerawada, had enabled him to get information about Shenoy's ATM pin, personal details and the cash in his account.     After killing Shenoy, Gadhve had stolen his cards and withdrawn money from various places in the course of three days. Gadhve, who was nabbed by the police in connection with a burglary, had confessed to killing Shenoy and the CCTV footage from the ATM kiosk showed him withdrawing cash using Shenoy's stolen card.     During interrogation at the Paud police station, he revealed that he had handed over the cards to his wife. "When we went to his house, we did not find the cards. Later, his wife confessed that she had burned them soon after Gadhve's arrest," said police inspector Vishambar Golde, in-charge of Paud station.     She was arrested for destroying evidence under IPC 201 and presented before the court after which she was sent to magisterial custody and then to the women's section of the Yerawada Central Prison.     Gadhve's remand ended on Wednesday, after which he has been sent to magisterial custody and then to Yerawada jail. "He was in police custody for nine days. We have completed the panchnama and we do not want any further custody," said Golde. Gadhve also has 14 cases pending against him.||PUNE

These arms were reportedly used in the violence that rocked the Barrackpore commissionarate during the run-up to the civic elections and on the poll day.     The gang had even allegedly dared to open unregistered security agencies in the Titagarh-Bhatpara belt so that they could buy the double-barrel weapons to build an armory. "The entire arsenal was bought with money allotted on the instructions of a Barrackpore leader who was opposed to an influential neta from Bhatpara," the CID said.     Besides conducting searched in Khardah and Titagarh, the CID on Wednesday questioned the owners of the six houses in Kalyani from where the arms were seized. But all the six reportedly denied any knowledge of arms being manufactured there. "An interrogation of the eight arrested during the bust has revealed that a single shotter would be sold for Rs 1,200-1,500. The cost would decrease with the number of guns ordered. Usually single-shotter cartridges were sold for Rs 25 each, but whenever 40 or more were ordered, the cost of each cartridge was bought down to Rs 10-15," said an officer. "The deal for .9mm pistols witnessed most bargaining, as it fetched anything between Rs 17,000 and Rs 35,000. Some of the weapons were even supplied to gangs operating in the building syndicates on BT Road."     CID officers also said they were investigating the role of a Nadia political leader. "The arms were supplied to a few gangs operating in Ranaghat as well. What might have started as an experiment to supplement own needs, turned in to a full-fledged business," the police said.     The 297 sq-km Barrackpore industrial belt has witnessed at least 16 incidents of murder and robbery in barely six months. The frequent shootouts, gang wars, bomb blasts and robbery have raised concerns about the easy availability of fire arms and their indiscriminate use.     "While big-ticket realty projects started coming up in Dum Dum, Kamarhati, north Barrackpore, Sodepur and Khardah, a syndicate supplying building material flourished and petty criminals started dominating the area," a promoter in Sodepur said.||KOLKATA

Around 6 am on July 14, Narinder Singh, the NRI and resident of Jhammat village, and his friend Sunny, a resident of Gawaddi, had allegedly shot dead Narinder's brother Bhupinder Singh, the sarpanch of Jhammat, while he was waiting outside for the health club to open in his Toyota Innova.    Haibowal police SHO Amarjeet Singh said the duo was arrested from a police check post on Hambran road on Tuesday evening. "They were going towards Hambran in a Maruti Swift that did not have a number plate when they were signalled down to stop and were arrested," the SHO said.    The police official said the weapon used in the crime is yet to be recovered. He said the exact sequence of events and the reason behind the crime will be reached only after the accused are questioned by the police.    Police have CCTV footage as evidence. After the murder, raids were conducted at the houses of friends and relatives of the accused, but to no avail. CTV footage of the 16-second incident had gone viral on Whatsapp after the incident. The footage, apparently taken from a business establishment, shows a man, said to be Narinder, in a cap. The man walks near to the driver's seat of Innova and pumps bullets into Bhupinder, and the duo runs away. A person is seen riding a motorcycle nearby.    After registering a case against the duo on the statement of an uncle of the deceased, police had also got a lookout notice issued against the NRI, so that he cannot escape to Canada. They had also informed the Canadian embassy.  ||LUDHIANA

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:32 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Tihar has also refuted police's claims that the accused and deceased were kept in the same jail. "Being in one jail doesn't mean they were in the same cell or ward. In jail number 5, for example, there are 1,000 inmates. Rule 25 of the jail manual categorically states that the commissioner of police has to inform the jail authorities about the criminals," an officer from Tihar said.    Jail authorities claimed that the undertrials had not left Tihar Jail in the same van but were mysteriously being brought back together. This was denied by the police. "In the van in question, we had deputed 15 personnel including an assistant sub-inspector, two head constables, 11 constables and the driver," an official said.    Jail authorities questioned the role of such security. "The security personnel have pepper spray and smoke grenades which they could have used to separate the two groups. However, they chose to be spectators. How could 15 armed cops not intervene and control seven unarmed undertrials? Their role is fishy," a jail officer said.    However, police counter these claims saying there was busy traffic on the road and a violent mob had gathered around the van. "Had the undertrials planned to escape or received support from outside, it would have been dangerous. We could not predict their plan then and had to be cautious," a DAP officer said.      ||NEW DELHI

Police suspect the role of a household help employed a week ago as he has been missing since the incident. The house was ransacked and cash and jewellery worth lakhs kept in a locker found missing.    The woman, Shanti Chopra, was a former district council member of BJP. The incident was reported around 8pm when a family friend arrived at the house in A-Block of Matia Khan. Neighbours said that Chopra would usually sit outside her house in lane number 12 in the evening, but did not come out on Wednesday.    They grew suspicious when the gate was found locked and the lights switched off. A neighbour then jumped into the premises and saw her lying in a pool of blood. They called the cops after which a team from the local police station reached the spot and broke open the door.    Police said there were no signs of a forced entry suggesting an insider's role. The killer had a scuffle with the woman before she was bludgeoned. The murder weapon, a bat used for washing clothes, was found lying beside her.    Family members said that Chopra used to stay with her physically challenged sons. Her husband, Bhuta Ram, owned a few hotels in the area and had died two years ago.    Preliminary investigations suggest that the killer jumped out of a toilet window after locking the doors from inside. "It seems she was robbed and then murdered. We are probing from all angles, including the domestic help's role," said DCP (central) Parmaditya.    The woman's nephew, Rohit Kumar, said that she had employed the help through a placement agency for Rs 30,000. The youth was from Gumla in Jharkhand. Her sons, Rajesh and Rakesh, were in another room when the incident occurred. "They cannot move on their own so couldn't have helped her during the assault," Rohit said. Police are going to question the sons and they have been kept under medical supervision.    The body has been sent for autopsy at JPN hospital, which will be conducted on Thursday.  ||NEW DELHI

And filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt was shocked by the striking similarities to a script he had written for his protege Guroudev Bhalla. "I empathise with the living hell Pater is going through and this is not a pathetic attempt to ride on his unspeakable tragedy. But bizarre as it may sound, fact is that this is a case of life imitating fiction rather than fiction imitating life," he says.The story Bhatt has penned, 'Ab Raat Guzarnewali Hai', was completed in May and will be produced by Dhaval Jayantilal Gada. It is a story of crime and passion, soaked in blood, revolving around a mother and daughter. While Bhatt refuses to get into details, he admits that it plays itself out in a media space with characters intoxicated on fame and power, flushed with money and caught in multi-partner, bi-sexual relationships. The story grew out of my imagination. I never imagined that it could be unfolding for real in a highrise in our backyard where the rich and powerful reside. The coincidence between a pure work of fiction and real life staggers me, it makes me shudder," he admits.Now, with the Indrani-Sheena story grabbing headlines, will some of their real-life story creep into his reel-life story? "No, my work is done," says Bhatt. "I only wrote this story for my protege. The film should roll in December. I never imagined that it would explode for real as the mother of all crime stories."||

Excerpts...Yesterday, on Times Now. All this while, our mother had been telling me that she has settled in the US. I believed her and asked for her phone number or email so that I could wish her and know about her well-being. But she wouldn't give me contact details.In 2012, when she had come to Guwahati to attend the marriage of one of her friends. She stayed with us for two days and returned to Mumbai where she was working with Reliance. After February 2012, there was no contact with her. Her friends tried to contact her on Facebook but there was no contact. Her Facebook account was deactivated.What relationship? She sort of abandoned me when I was just about three months old. My sister was about two years then. We were raised by our maternal grandparents here in Guwahati. After our birth, Indrani went to Mumbai for higher studies. After a few years, she completed her studies from St Xaviers, then she got a job in Reliance as an HR manager. I met her when I had just completed my schooling. She told me and my sister that she doesn't want to introduce both of us as her children. When we met her in Kolkata for the first time, she told us that she would introduce us as her sister and brother. She said she has a high position in society and doesn't want to tell the world that we are her children.At first it sounded weird. But then she promised to raise us and we thought we can pursue our studies if we get her help. We had no option but to agree. Since then, Sheena was her sister, not daughter, and I was her brother, not son.No. Sheena moved to Mumbai for her studies and stayed with her till 2012, when she had a major fight with her. Then she moved out and started living in a rented house. I was in New Delhi, working with Lufthansa.Because there was no one to look after my old grandparents. Once they were very ill and then she had come to Guwahati. She wanted to take them to Mumbai with her. I asked her where she will keep her parents and she said in an old-age home. I said no and offered to leave my job and stay with my grandparents in Guwahati. My grandfather is diabetic and my grandmother is still recovering from a hip bone fracture. I came to Guwahati to look after my grandparents in 2011.She used to, but not any longer. Our only source of income is from the rent that we get from our tenants. I cannot go out to work because I cannot leave my grandparents alone in the house for even a minute. Financially, we are very weak. She used to give us a little bit of funding. Every time I asked her she used to say that "I will stop your money." So I had no choice but to accept what she said.I am certain that my mother has murdered her. I have got the evidence and will give it to Mumbai Police when they come here. I only want to know why she murdered her own daughter. Some other people are also involved.My biological father never had any contact with us. So, I think it is irrelevant to reveal his identity now.Justice and that can happen only when my mother confesses to her crime or else I will reveal all. We were in the same age group and she was more of a friend to me. When I was working in New Delhi, Sheena was is in Mumbai. She would pay me surprise visits on my birthdays.Yes, I knew about it. Peter Mukerjea also told me about this and I asked him to talk it out with both of them.Yes, I firmly believe she can do it. Now, I fear something might happen to me as well. She is too powerful. There is nothing left for me to consider her as my mother. There was Sheena's friend who lives in the US. She told me Sheena is not in the US; if she would have been, she would have contacted her. Then I had a doubt. Every time I asked where Sheena is and asked for her number and email ID, Indrani would say she is okay. She said Sheena is well-settled now; she doesn't want to contact us. Just leave her alone.|| 
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/NewsX-telecast-of-Aarushi-honour-killing-irked-Indrani/articleshow/48688279.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||MUMBAI: There's a certain irony in Indrani Mukerjea being accused of her daughter's 'honour killing'. It was May 2008 and she was CEO of the INX Group, which operated the NewsX channel. The UP police, which had been investigating Aarushi Talwar's murder, claimed at a press conference that it was an honour killing. Indrani was livid that the channel had telecast the entire press meet live. It went against NewX's brief that it was not meant to be an 'ambulance-chasing' channel, she said. She even questioned the wider appeal of the story saying "honour killings are not that rare".Indrani displayed flamboyance of a kind usually associated with power couples. Along with husband Peter Mukherjea, she founded INX Media and INX News in 2007, of which she was the CEO. Peter was the chairman and the group chief strategy officer.Groomed as an HR consultant, Indrani came across at meetings and interactions as somewhat overbearing. During meetings, she always tried to give the impression of being in complete command.During her brief encounters with the staff, she even eclipsed Peter, one of India's best-known TV executives. He seemed content to let Indrani run the show. During the meetings, a smiling Peter was mostly seen gazing at Indrani as she occupied the centre stage.In fact, at the meeting to announce the 'sacking' of Vir Sanghvi and some others, it was Indrani who did most of the talking to the rest of the staff, recalls a former employee. Her former colleagues claim she was a person with strong 'likes' and 'dislikes' and only lent her ears to those she liked.||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/She-always-carried-pic-of-a-little-girl-boy-Khanna/articleshow/48688177.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||MUMBAI: The Sheena Bora murder case took a new turn when police confirmed that she was Indrani Mukerjea's daughter from a previous marriage in Assam and not her sisterâ€”a fact that neither her second nor third husband Sanjeev Khanna and Peter Mukerjea, respectively, had any clue of.TOI spoke to Sanjeev Khanna who lives in Kolkata, just before his arrest on Wednesday afternoon.Khanna runs a wireless communication business and has not remarried. "I met Indrani in 1990, a few months after she had moved to Calcutta. She was doing a computer course and lived as a paying guest. We dated for a while and decided to get married in 1993." The ceremony was a small one with "hardly anyone from Indrani's side of the family," said Khanna. He never got to meet anyone in her family "except Indrani's father, just once."Her parents had objected to her marriage, he said, which was why she chose to cut off ties with them and never went back to see them.Khanna recalls seeing Indrani carry an old photograph of a little girl and a boy with her at all times. "This was just after we got married. When I asked her who they were she told me that they were her brother and sister. I would try and encourage her to mend things with her family but she would refuse to keep in touch."It was in 2001, after Indrani moved to Mumbai with the HR placement agency she founded, that she fell out with Khanna. "She always wanted to make it big and I never stopped her," says Khanna, who was in the dark about Sheena and Michail or Indrani's first relationship until Wednesday morning. Sanjeev and Indrani have a daughter called Vidhie who was nine years old when Indrani tied the knot with Peter Mukerjea. Vidhie took on the Mukerjea surname. She was studying at the University of Bristol and expected to move to London this September.Most friends and business associates expressed shock when the news broke as they remember Indrani as an "affable" and "amicable lady".Suhel Seth, a close friend of Peter Mukerjea, remembers the time when the couple met for the first time. "It was at a party I had hosted at the Old Library Bar at the Taj President. We were sitting at a tableâ€”Peter with his (then) girlfriend Sapna, Murli Deora and Sumantra Dutta when Alyque (Padamsee) walked in with Indrani. Three days later Peter told me in Delhi that they were seeing each other."It was a small wedding ceremony that took place in Suhel Seth's garden house in Delhi in 2002 and much like her second marriage with Khanna, this wedding too barely saw anyone from her family. "No one from her immediate family attended," said Seth.Alyque Padamsee, who had played cupid and introduced Peter and Indrani at Suhel's party, was aghast when he heard of the news for the first time when TOI called him."Goodness gracious me! I can't believe Indrani could do such a thing. I remember her as a party-going person and I introduced them at the same table. She was waiting to get her divorce at that time."Filmmaker Rensil D Silva remembers Peter and Indrani's business equation when Peter had helped give a headstart to O&M's second agencyMeridian back in 2008 with the launch of 9X, of which he was the founder and strategy officer, and Indrani, the CEO."This was the first campaign we did. Peter came on board as a well-wisher and most of the launch discussions would happen with Indrani's approval. Peter entrusted her with all the approval powers and made her the one-point contact," says Rensil. "Peter was never a traditional client with his great business acumen and understanding of the media. Indrani had a similar approach. She was more of a collaborator without a master-slave attitude. After they left 9X, we continued for a while but the company was quite headless without them and we ended our relation with 9X soon after."Author and journalist Avirook Sen had had a slanging match with Indrani before leaving NewsX. A lot of what he had written during those days of tussle is still online.On being asked about Indrani's case now, Sen said, "I stand by what I wrote then. It has nothing to do whatsoever with any of the events unfolding now. I have lost all contact with them."The arrest has come as a shock to the Mukerjea family. "We are in the dark," said Peter's brother Gautam Mukerjea who runs a lifestyle magazine and finds himself involved in the sordid saga. Refuting allegations that the couple had siphoned off huge sums of money from the company in the name of various family members, Gautam said, "No money has come into my account. Whatever we have learned is from television," said Gautam confirming that at one point he did work as a salaried employee of 9X media.||MUMBAI

"What has happened makes us sad and angry. I still hope that it isn't true."  Many of Bora's batchmates from college took to social media on Wednesday as news of the murder made headlines. By the end of the day, they began to question the mystery behind her absence for three long years. "Friends, if we have any info about Sheena, please do share. We need to inject some logic into this case. We know how high-profile cases are treated in the country. Let's try? We might have already lost Sheena but let's not give up yet? Any clues, any contact at any point, something?' read a friend's post, which was shared by many of her friends.  One tweeted that Sheena had mentioned once in college that she was Indrani's daughter from her first marriage. The same friend also mentioned that she was in touch with Sheena till 2011.  One tweeted: "She became untraceable 2012 onwards... I had heard from others that she was abroad for masters or something."  Another friend mentioned that her friends did try to find her but the family assured the cops that she was fine and "starting a new life". Some of her friends tweeted with the hashtag #justiceforsheena. One mentioned that Rahul Mukerjea, with whom she was in a relationship with, should come out with his side of the story.  According to the police, Sheena had come to Mumbai in 2006 and completed her BA in Economics from St Xavier's College. One of her professors, Hermione Salazar, who retired last year, said she remembered Sheena very vaguely for her sincerity and diligence. "She was not among the top 15 students in the class and hardly participated in classroom discussions, but she was sincere," said Salazar. "I remember how she was the only student to have travelled all the way to rural Maharashtra to get primary data, while all the others choose to use published data. She wanted to go and find the data for herself," said the professor who taught Bora macroeconomics and research methodology. "She took the trouble to regularly visit the village. It was a project on school facilities in the peripheral region of Maharashtra," she added. The project was for macroeconomics and was presented in a seminar at Khandala, recollected the professor, adding that the new is very shocking.  "We did not know anything about her personal life," said another professor. "She was a very simple girl, who was dressed simply and had unkempt hair. In fact, we could not recognize her in the photos being flashed on television channels," added the professor.  (With Mohua Das)  ||MUMBAI

Police pursued the suspect and in the late morning, an ABC local affiliate and CNN reported the suspected shooter had shot himself, but it was not known if he was dead or alive. The suspect was identified as Vester Flanagan, 41, according to a dispatcher for the Augusta County, Virginia, Sheriff's department.    After the shooting of the journalists, someone claiming to have filmed it posted video online that appeared to be from shooter's vantage point.    The videos were posted to a Twitter account and on Facebook but were removed shortly afterward. One video clearly showed a handgun as the person filming approached the woman reporter.    The shooting occurred at about 6:45 a.m. EDT (1045 GMT) during an interview being broadcast live from Bridgewater Plaza, a Smith Mountain Lake recreation site with restaurants, shops, boating and arcades and holiday rentals.    The area is in the south-central part of the state, about 120 miles (190 km) from the capital of Richmond.    The journalists were filming an interview for the morning news show of CBS affiliate WDBJ7 in Roanoke, Virginia. In the broadcast, shots were heard and the reporter and the person being interviewed screamed and ducked for cover.    The reporter Alison Parker, 24, and the cameraman, Adam Ward, 27, died in the incident, WDBJ7 said. The woman being interviewed was wounded.    Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said in interview on Washington radio station WTOP that the suspected shooter had been identified as a disgruntled current or former station employee.    The Franklin County Sheriff's Office has taken the lead on apprehending the suspect, with help from state police and others, McAuliffe told WTOP.    "Heartbroken over senseless murders today in Smith Mountain Lake," McAuliffe said on Twitter.    Asked on CNN if the station had been targeted or had been threatened, WDBJ7 President and General Manager Jeff Marks said, "Every now and then you get a crazy email or something and we'll look into it. Nothing of this nature than any of us could recall."    He said the interview was to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of Smith Mountain Lake, and the woman being interviewed was from the local chamber of commerce. She had been talking about the anniversary and tourism.    "We don't make a secret of where we report from, we may start now," Marks said.    There was no word yet from the hospital on the condition of the woman, identified as Vicki Gardner, executive director of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce.    The station's broadcast showed Parker interviewing Gardner about the lake and tourism development in the area. Gunshots erupted, and as Ward fell his camera hit the ground but kept running. An image caught on camera showed what appeared to be a man in dark clothing facing the camera with a weapon in his right hand.    The station said on its website that both the dead journalists were from the region.    Parker grew up in Martinsville and attended Patrick Henry Community College and James Madison University, while Ward graduated from Salem High School and Virginia Tech, the station said.    They were both engaged to be married to other people.||

The same day they drove to Raigad where they disposed the body after setting on fire using petrol.     The Khar police stumbled on the murder mystery when they arrested Mukherjea's driver Rai, acting on a tip-off, who was found in possession of 7.62 mm loaded pistol on August 21.     Rai took the investigators to the spot where they dumped Sheena's body.     The local police at Raigad found her skeletal body on May 23, 2012. However, there was no case of missing registered anywhere and the matter remained untraced.     "Inquiries with the local police at Raigad confirmed Rai's confession. Total three arrest has been made in the case. Indrani has confessed that Sheena was her daughter," Mumbai Commissioner of Police Rakesh Maria.     Maria said the trio strangulated Sheena in a car in the city and burnt her body using petrol.     "There was no missing complaint registered. The case has been registered on August 21 after Rai's arrest for possession of arms illegally. Indrani's former husband Khanna will be brought to Mumbai after completing the legal formalities in Kolkata," Maria said.||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:38 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.

I know the exact reason of the murder and it is not the ones that are being told to the media," Sheena's brother Mikhail Bora, who stays with his maternal grandparents here, told reporters.Asked about the motive behind the murder, he said, "I am sorry, I will not tell it to you now. I will wait till she (Indrani Mukerjea) confesses it in front of police. If she does not, then I will do whatever is necessary."Bora said Sheena was his own sister and "it is shocking that our own mother introduced her daughter as her sister. That means she was telling lies from the beginning."Indrani had taken Sheena along with her to Mumbai for higher studies and admitted her at St Xavier's College. Later, Sheena had joined a corporate house as an employee."I did not know that my sister was no more till this news came in. When she disappeared in 2012, mother used to tell me that Sheena had gone to USA for higher studies. Even when she (Indrani) visited Guwahati in 2013, she told us that Sheena was fine and is in the US," Mikhail said.TV grab.Indrani left her two children with her parents here and settled outside Assam after her first marriage.Mikhail said they met their mother only around 12 years back when Indrani had visited Guwahati."After that, she used to send money for us and our grandparents.

Tragedy had stuck the sterilisation camps, organised by the health department, at Sakri on Nov 8, 2014 and at Gaurella, Pendra and Marwahi, all in Bilaspur district, on Nov 10, 2014. The findings of the judicial commission are mostly on the anticipated lines as the state government had subsequently cracked down on drug manufacturing companies after some antibiotics were found substandard and also on doctors who had conducted the surgeries. While 13 women had died, 122 others were left ailing after the botched surgeries.    The main doctor at the camp, Dr RK Gupta, had in fact conducted 83 sterilisation operations at the Takhtpur health camp within a short span of three and half hours, spending just two and half minutes on each per surgery. Dr Gupta was subsequently arrested.    Initial tests reports conducted on the antibiotics, Ciprocin, distributed at the camp, had confirmed presence of rat poison (Zinc Phosphide). The police had subsequently booked the directors of Mahawar Pharmaceutical and Kavita Pharma Company under charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Sec 304 IPC). Interestingly, lab reports later from some labs in Delhi and Mumbai had concluded that while the medicines were substandard, there was no poison in it.    The judicial commission report, which was taken up at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, will now be tabled in the Vidhan Sabha in the next session. The cabinet has decided that stringent disciplinary action, as applicable under the law, would be taken against concerned officials of the health and family welfare department and the drug manufacturers and suppliers of substandard and poison contaminated medicines (Ciprocin 500 and ibrufen 400) distributed in the sterilization camps.    The cabinet has also accepted all the recommendation of the commission regarding precautions that need to be taken in order to prevent such tragedies in future. The details of the recommendation, were however not available immediately.||RAIPUR

The executions brought to 127 the number this year in Saudi Arabia, compared with 87 in 2014, according to AFP tallies compiled from interior ministry statements.     Saudi Nawaf al-Otaibi was executed in the western city of Taif after being convicted of shooting dead his father in a dispute, the interior ministry said.     Fellow Saudis Bandar al-Ghathim and Abdulaziz Mohammed al-Zahrani were executed in the country's southwest for murder, the ministry said in statements carried by state news agency SPA.     Syrian Ezzeddine al-Saleh was executed in the northern Jawf region for trafficking in amphetamines, the ministry said.     Under Saudi Arabia's strict legal practices, murder, armed robbery, rape, drug trafficking and apostasy are all punishable by death.     Most people sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia are beheaded, but sometimes firing squads are used.     Amnesty International yesterday criticised Saudi Arabia's "deeply flawed judicial system" as it issued a new report on the rising number of executions.     The London-based group criticised trials it said "blatantly flout international standards", citing secret hearings, denying defendants access to lawyers and convictions based on confessions "obtained under torture".     "Saudi Arabia's sharia (Islamic) law-based justice system lacks a criminal code, leaving definitions of crimes and punishments vague and widely open to interpretation," Amnesty said.     Amnesty says Saudi Arabia is one of the world's most prolific executioners, along with China, Iran, Iraq and the US.     ||RIYADH

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:43 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Mihail Bora, Sheena Bora's brother speaking to TV channels confirmed he and Sheena were Indrani's children. He told CNN IBN, "Have no doubt my mother Indrani killed my sister Sheena Bora.""Whenever I asked Indrani about my sister, she would tell me that she was abroad and too busy to speak to me," he added.Peter Mukerjea, Indrani's husband, also spoke to CNN IBN. "Sheena was having affair with my younger son and Indrani did not approve of their relationship," he said.Cops have arrested Indrani Mukerjea, wife of one of India's most high-profile broadcast media executives, for the murder of Sheena in a case that is sensational for at least two reasons: the dramatis personae involved and the way in which the alleged killers covered their tracks and escaped all suspicion for three years.The case would have remained one more of Mumbai Police's unsolved cases had an informer not tipped off the cops about the murder that occurred three years ago. He told cops that he had information about the murder of Sheena Bora that occurred in 2012 and could also lead them to the murderer and the victim's body.Khar cops picked up Mukerjea's driver a few days ago based on this information and started grilling him and he confessed to having murdered Bora at Mukerjea's behest. He also told the cops that he dumped Bora's body in the forests of Raigad. Mumbai cops then got in touch with their counterparts in Raigad, who confirmed that the remains of an unknown woman were found from the same spot.Khar police then arrested the driver and then, based on his confession, asked Mukerjea to present herself for questioning on Tuesday. She was arrested after a three-hour grilling session.Peter Mukerjea with wife Indrani MukerjeaBoth of them were produced in the Bandra Metropolitan Magistrate's court on Tuesday and cops got their custody till August 31.

Police commissioner S Murugan said they will be produced before a court soon. They have been booked under IPC's sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 397 (robbery or dacoity). Of the arrested, some belong to the Bajrang Dal, VHP and Hindu Yuva Sene.     On Monday evening, the right-wing activists stripped Shakir from Kulur, tied him to an electricity pole and assaulted in public view after he was found with a girl from another community.

She alleged Shakir had been harassing her. Based on the complaint, a case has been registered under IPC's Section 354 (assault or criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty). She also accused Shakir of misbehaving with her once while dropping her in his car from Nandigudde to Bikkarnakatte.

Everyone has a cold one as they appreciate Kumar Sangakkara's silky smooth off-drive.There is a huge portrait that graces the pub, of Sir Donald Bradman and Mahadevan Sathasivam, the captains of Australia XI and Ceylon XI respectively in a match played here in 1948. The latter is one of the biggest heroes in this part of the world, probably adored as much as Bradman is around the world.Ask every old-timer about the greatest batsman they have seen, and instead of Donald Bradman's name, the answer you will get is Sathasivam. They say his grace, elegance and poise at the crease were unparalleled.The record books say that he only played in 11 first-class games, with an average of 41.83 and a highest score of 215. But more than his runs, those who knew him swear by the fact that he was one of the greatest gentleman cricketers from this part of the world.However, there is a stigma attached to Sathasivam as well. He married Paripoornam Anandam Rajendra, a granddaughter of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan in 1941, and was subsequently accused of murdering his wife in 1951. There was a protracted 20-month trial during his which he spent time in jail as well, but it was thanks to his lawyer Colvin R de Silva that he was finally acquitted.According to Sri Lanka's Sunday Times newspaper, "On the morning of October 9, 1951, a little after 9.30, the domestic help, Marambage William, was scraping a coconut for the midday meal when the master of the house came into the kitchen, seized him by the hand and dragged him upstairs to the master bedroom. On the way up, the master said he had a job for the boy, and that was to kill his wife. Marambage William refused, saying he would leave the house right away without his pay."The master went up to the bed, caught his wife by the throat with one hand, her hair with the other hand, pushed her onto the floor and started to throttle her. He ordered William to grab the lady's struggling body. When the lady had stopped struggling, the master went downstairs, closed the front door, and returned," the newspaper said. Sathasivam's lawyer De Silva clinically took apart the above testimony of his servant. They flew down forensic expert Sir Sidney Smith from England and his testimony was what helped sway the verdict."De Silva was a member of the Tamil Union Cricket Club. He knew Sathasivam and his family very well. He believed in his innocence and that's why he chose to defend him."Everything was special about Sathasivam. He was a classy man and a great gentleman. We used to have drinks together. But after the trial got over, he was never too interested in cricket. He chose to go into business and we helped him get his life together," 80-year-old Renil Iyer told TOI on Friday."De Silva used to be a politician but he lost his seat because he defended Sathasivam. But he had no regrets," Iyer added.Percy Abeysekera, one of Lanka's oldest fans, remembers the trial well. "Sathasivam was one of the most popular cricketers of our time. I heard even Frank Worrell came to visit him when he was in jail. But everyone believed he was innocent," Percy said.Whatever the mystery, on the cricket field Sathasivam remains a hero for all generations.||COLOMBO

The seven-year-old son of the couple called villagers on Tuesday morning after the dacoits escaped. Senior police officials, including the SP (trans-Ganga) and forensic experts reached the spot and carried out investigations.     Station officer of Soraon said that the couple identified as Neelesh (32) and his wife Mona (28) were targeted by the dacoits. Their son Vansh witnessed the killing of his parents and called villagers on Tuesday morning and apprised them about the dacoity. The couple's two other children aged four and one-year were sleeping. Hundreds of villagers assembled outside the house of the couple. A villager dialled 100 at around 6:45 am to informed police.     The police collected forensic evidences and talked to villagers and Vansh to know more about the incident. Vansh replied the queries of cops and said that he woke up after hearing the sound of bullet. The robbers had shot Neelesh at point-blank range and also stabbed his wife to death. Circumstantial evidences point out that both husband and wife had resisted the dacoits.     The villagers told police that Neelesh had recently sold a piece of his agriculture land and got Rs 20 lakh for it. It could be a reason of the killing as the dacoits might have thought that the couple has kept the cash inside the house. The household articles were found scattered. Investigations revealed that dacoits had managed to enter the house through roof.         ||ALLAHABAD

Setting aside the conviction, justice S Nagamuthu and justice V S Ravi wondered why the complaint had not been marked by police and said the appellants were right in claiming that there was grave suspicion about the complaint.     The accused, according to prosecution, murdered one Rasaiah on May 25, 2005 at Alampatti near Andipatti in Theni district to avenge the murder of one Thangavelu, who was a relative of one of the accused.     The Rajathani police in Theni investigated Rasaiah's murder case. The principal and district sessions court, Theni found them guilty of the offence and sentenced them to life imprisonment on April 21, 2015.     Aggrieved over it, the seven preferred an appeal before the Madras high court Madurai bench. When the matter was heard by justice S Nagamuthu, the counsel appearing for the appellants' side pointed out many lapses in the prosecution.     The counsel said there was contradiction of evidences in the case. Time and place of occurrence had not been established. The complaint pertaining to the crime was not adduced as evidence, the counsel said. Denying it, the government side argued.     After hearing, the judges said there were many contradictions in the evidence of the main witness and the second primary witness in the case.||MADURAI

None of the three executives was injured but they said the bike-borne duo fired on their Verna multiple times during a hot pursuit from Sector 4 in Vaishali to Shakti Khand in Indirapuram. The shooting, they told police, had taken place between 10 and 10.30am.    Lalit Sangwan (37), a field officer with the firm who was at the wheel, said he had accidentally brushed the bike near the bridge on the Hindon canal in Sector 4.    "We were going towards Noida but took a U-turn when the man riding pillion whipped out a gun," Sangwan said. "The first shot hit near the left front door of the car even as we sped towards our office in Indirapuram. Two more shots grazed the roof. One of us dialled 100. When we reached our office, we shut the gate and ran inside. The men fired two shots at the gate and fled," he added.    Sangwan said he and colleagues Harish Sharma and Rakesh Yadav had given the cops two bullets that had stuck to the gate. "There's a CCTV camera installed at the gate of a school adjoining our office. Its footage can be studied for clues," he said.    The bikers were booked for attempt to murder in a case filed at Indirapuram. But the police said they had not been able to find a single eyewitness to corroborate the version of the three executives. A police officer said a team met the executives at their office in Indirapuram and did a recce of route which they alleged they had been chased but were unable to find witnesses.    "Prima facie, there appear to be many loopholes in the version of events narrated to cops by the victims. The case is, however, being investigated thoroughly. No conclusions have been made till now," said Ghaziabad DSP Atul Yadav.    One of the executives, however, said the police team questioned some roadside workers, who claimed not to have seen anything. He said an examination of CCTV footage, the bullets they had handed over and a thorough investigation would prove their claim.  ||GHAZIABAD
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/Cong-MLA-arrested-near-assembly-say-colleagues/articleshow/48672936.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||RANCHI: Congress leaders here said the party's Barkagaon MLA, Nirmala Devi, was arrested from outside the state assembly on Tuesday evening while she was coming out of the building after attending the monsoon session. An arrest warrant was pending against Nirmala Devi in an attempt to murder case lodged in Hazaribag on August 16. Though a group of policemen allegedly arrested her in full public view, officials in Hazaribag and Ranchi did not confirm it.    Congress's Jamtara MLA Irfan Ansari, who attended the monsoon session along with Devi, said: "She was arrested when she was coming out of the assembly. This is against the norms of the assembly. A public representative is being treated like a hardcore criminal. Police have levelled false charges against her. The government is trying to undermine Congress legislators."    All six Congress legislators have decided to protest against the arrest in the assembly on Wednesday. Quoting relatives of Nirmala Devi, Ansari said: "A team of Hazaribag police arrested her and they took her to Hazaribag." Hazaribag SP Akhilesh Jha did not confirm the arrest.    Assembly speaker Dinesh Oraon told TOI: "I have heard about her arrest, but she was arrested outside the assembly campus. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the speaker." About the legality of arresting an MLA when a session is on, Oraon said: "As far as I know, an MLA can be arrested outside the premises of the assembly even when the session is on."    Devi's husband Yogendra Sao, a former Congress minister, was arrested on August 21 in the same case. Devi with her husband and dozens of supporters had held a rally outside National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Barkagaon project on August 14. The NTPC is constructing houses to rehabilitate people displaced due to its project.    Sao held the rally to demand better compensation for the displaced. After the rally was over, he and his supporters wanted to go to the construction site to inspect the work. The police stopped them because it feared that they might ransack the under-construction houses. "They tried to force their way beyond the security barricades and attacked the policemen who tried to stop them. About 20 policemen were injured, two of them critically," a police officer said. Police booked 66 people, including Sao and his wife, under various sections of the IPC.  ||RANCHI

Jana was killed in a clash between alleged supporters of CP and Trinamool Chhatra Parishad (TMCP).     Police summoned first-year student Sudip Patra on Monday night and interrogated him. Police said Patra was in front of the college union room during the clash.     He was slapped with murder charge (Section 302 of IPC) and several other charges.     Patra was produced in Midnapore CJM's court on Tuesday and was remanded in five days' police custody.     West Midnapore SP Bharati Ghosh said, "CCTV footage showed that Patra was in front of the college union room on the day of the incident."     Sabang Congress MLA Manas Bhuniya alleged that police was selectively arresting CP supporters.||SABANG

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:47 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Doctors-hubby-questions-police-theory/articleshow/48676013.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||CHENNAI: The murder of Dr S Sathya, a 32-year-old post-graduate student of Kilpauk Medical College, on Friday has taken a curious turn with her husband picking holes in the police story and suggesting the hand of "someone interested in usurping her PG seat." Police had arrested Harintham Depnath, a 22-year-old engineering graduate who lived on the second floor of the building.     Dr P Seshu, a general physician who works as a block development officer in Perambalur, in his petition to the deputy commissioner of police, Kilpauk cited that the stab injuries on Sathya's neck suggested that the murder was committed by someone who had knowledge of human anatomy.     "The killer clearly damaged vital structures such as trachea and carotid arteries, the major blood vessels in the neck that supplies blood to brain. There was no injury below the neck. It looks like this person knew something about medicine," he said.     Dr Sathya was pursuing her first year MS in obstetrics and gynecology at KMC. "If the MS seat falls vacant within the first six months, it could be allotted to someone else. It is probable that someone wanted the seat," he told TOI. Seshu said police have done a shabby job and that the fingerprints lifted from the crime spot had not matched with those of Harintham Depnath, the accused. "The case is too weak without substantial proof," he said. Police had brought a sniffer dog to the scene of crime, he said, but the dog did not run to the second floor where the accused lived. "This is unusual, given that police say the accused had dried his blood-stained shirt upstairs."     He said he had visited his wife at least five times in the past two months, and have never seen Depnath. "Several questions remain unanswered. It beats me why police chose not to question the maid who went missing more than a week before the murder. Curiously, a CCTV camera in the adjacent apartment remained switched off from 8.30am to 5.26am on the day of the crime," he said. "If the murderer's motive was money, why did he leave behind her 10-sovereign jewellery?"     On Friday, Dr Sesu was taking care of a C-section birth at a primary health care centre when he received a call from a friend asking him to come to Chennai for a medical emergency. He said usually his wife calls him every morning, but that day she did not. He left home to attend a seminar and tried calling her up at 10.39am. She did not pick up the call. The mobile remained switched off since 11.23am.     ||CHENNAI

Police said Mohit Janghu was having tea with his maternal uncle when the accused pumped three bullets into him after an altercation, and then fled the spot.     A CCTV camera, installed in the vicinity, caught the killers standing by a car outside the cafe at 9pm and then going inside it. They were seen fleeing in their car at 9.12pm. Cops have arrested four out of the five accused from Himgiri Chowk near Sector 10A on Tuesday evening. Raids are being conducted to nab the fifth and also a sixth suspect in the case, police said.     According to the police, it was around 9pm when Janghu was sitting in Old Box Cafe in Sector 23A with his uncle Nahar Chaudhary, a resident of Islampur village, and the five men entered the cafe and shot him in his head, chest and stomach. A friend of Mohit's, Saksham, was also present there.     "I was having tea with my nephew Mohit and his friend Saksham when Abhishek alias Nitu came there along with four accomplices. Nitu was carrying a pistol. They started bashing Mohit and told him that he had escaped the last time but won't be able to do so now. Nitu then pulled out the pistol. I intervened but the two boys threw me aside and he shot Mohit four times. We were shocked and before we could do anything they fled after threatening us to stay quiet," Nahar Chaudhary told the police.     Chaudhary, Saksham, along with some others, rushed Mohit to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead. "We found three bullet wounds in the body. One bullet was found in the left side of the chest, while one was in the chest and another on the left side of the head. There was damage to the brain and excessive bleeding. Such victims cannot survive beyond a few minutes," said Dr Deepak Mathur, forensic expert.     While the exact cause of the murder has not been ascertained, police said Mohit and Abhishek had an altercation some 20 days ago in the same cafe, but they had resolved the issue and allegedly become friends. "However, preliminary investigation hints that the cause behind the murder is personal enmity," said ACP (crime) Rajesh Kumar.     Janghu, police said, has two cases lodged against him under Arms Act and Section 321 (causing hurt). He was also sent to judicial custody once, in the past, while Abhishek had been jailed in the past for illegal possession of arms.     "It turns out that a case was registered against the victim, Mohit, which we are verifying. We have formed special teams to nab the fifth accused as well and investigations are going on. The picture will soon be clear," said Kumar.     The accused â€” Abhishek alias Nitu, Munna, Dipankar and Bobby Dahiya â€” are from Dhanwapur village, while Brijesh alias Noni lives in Sector 71. While Munna is on the run, police are also trying to nab the sixth suspect Nitesh. All accused are between 18 to 25 years of age, and have been booked under sections 302 (murder), 120b (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and 25-54 and 59 of Arms Act.     While Mohit was 22 years old, his uncle had mentioned his age as 18 in the police complaint. Mohit had completed his schooling and was looking for a job. His elder brother Sachin is a student and his father a subedar in the Indian Army, who is currently deployed in Sikkim||GURGAON

The single bench of justice Atul Kumar Jain gave the order on the hearing of anticipatory bail petition by another accused Satish in the case. Two of the accused, Billu Bhagat and krishan Kumar were acquitted on January 23 this year by the additional session court Behrod on the ground that the victims failed to record her statements in the court.    The SHO Neemrana, who was personally present in the court on August 17 for the case, had given the statement that "The victim is not traceable and most probably she might have been murdered or kidnapped by the persons interested to stop her from giving evidence." The court had then directed to register a separate case of kidnapping and murder against unknown persons and report back on September 3.    But the victim surprisingly appeared in the court on August 24 along with SHO Neerama, Rajpal Singh. She alleged that the police was hand in glove with the accused. So, she was not given any summons to appear in the court, which resulted in the acquittal of the two accused.    The court, treating the matter as very serious, allowed her to stay in Nari Niketan in Jaipur and directed the lower court to examine her again.    The court further said the responsibly of her security during transit from Jaipur to Behrod and return, whenever she was summoned as witness in the court, would be of IG police headquarters, Jaipur.    The court also directed to send back the case dairy to the concerned public prosecutor and appointed lawyer Umesh Kumar Sharma as amicus curie. The court said the bail plea of Satish will be hard on September 3.  ||JAIPUR

Yadav is learnt to have assured help to the protesters, who also demanded arrest of mastermind Ankush Shendre's father Prabhakar.  The protesters claimed that a political conspiracy had been hatched to shield the murderers of Punatri Gautam and his brother-in-law Someshwar Patle last week near Tarodi village. The murder was committed over professional jealousy. The protesters claimed that Nandanvan police are working under political pressure. They also demanded that Yadav should probe the possible involvement of Dhawade brothers as the main planners of the murder, since Shendre allegedly worked for the goons.  One of the protesters sounded satisfied by the top cop's response to their demands, including a suggestion to move the case to a fast track court and appoint a special prosecutor to ensure the victims get justice. "We are now planning to rope in a lawyer to assist the prosecution," said a protester.||

Shockingly, the killings took place inside a jail van with cops looking on helplessly.The stage for the violence was set when two men from the Neetu Dabodia gang were put in the van carrying seven members of their bitter rivals, the Neeraj Bawana gang, including Bawana himself. Within minutes of the van leaving the Rohini courts for Tihar Jail, Bawana and his men had pounced on the duo, strangling them with bare hands and stomping over their faces with such viciousness that one of the victims had an eye gauged out.The orgy of violence continued for 10 long minutes. Such was the violence that the escorting Delhi Armed Police personnel couldn't get inside the undertrials' enclosure. A crowd of onlookers gathered around the van, that had just crossed the Mangolpuri flyover on the Outer Ring Road when the fight broke out. The crowd began pelting stones at the van and tried to set it ablaze.The van driver then drove straight to the nearby Mahavir hospital, where Paras Vikram and Pradeep Bhola were declared brought dead. Paras was the current head of the Neetu Dabodia gang after Dabodia's death in an encounter with the special cell in October 2013.This is the second gang war reported from the capital in the last three days and raise serious questions about Delhi Police commissioner B S Bassi's hold on the crime situation in the city.Tuesday's violence started around 5pm as the undertrials were being taken back to Tihar. Bawana and his men had come as accused in the murder trial of Dabodia's henchman Pradeep Dahiya, who was gunned down by the gang in Rani Bagh area last August.How the two rival gang members were put in the same van, against laid out protocol, is a question the police need to answer.There were nine undertrials in the bus. Bawana was accompanied by six close aides Naveen Bali, Rahul Kala, Naveen Bhanja, Sunil, Dinesh and Sunny. Paras had his trusted aide Pradeep Bhola with him.There are three sections in the jail van. The first is occupied by the driver, the van in-charge and a gunman. The middle enclosure is for undertrials and the rear one for Delhi Armed Police personnel.According to police accounts, as the jail van left the court and got onto the Mangolpuri flyover on Outer Ring Road, a fierce argument broke out among the rivals. Moments later, Bawana and his men attacked Paras and Bhola. In no time, a few of Bawana's men had a stranglehold on the duo. As the two resisted and tried to free themselves, the other members banged their heads on the seats and the van's walls. They put their feet on the victims' necks to ensure that they choked.As soon as the scuffle was noticed by the cops, they tried to rush in to rescue the two. But such was the level of violence that they couldn't get inside the enclosure. As the duo was declared 'dead on arrival' at Mahavir hospital, the Bawana gang members too claimed have sustained injuries and got themselves admitted. Cops say their injuries seemed self inflicted.A police enquiry has been ordered into the incident. The police brass is ascertaining how the two groups were put in the same van. Earlier, the court and the cops had been warned that the two gangs were planning to eliminate each other and should not be allowed to be together.An FIR under sections of murder and criminal conspiracy has been registered in the outer district.Cops will seek police remand of Bawana and his men to ascertain the conspiracy behind the attack. The special cell and crime branch have been alerted on the possibility of more violence between the two gangs inside Tihar Jail and outside. A close watch is being kept on the movements of the gangsters.||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Gang-which-killed-elderly-women-nabbed/articleshow/48675653.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||UDAIPUR: A notorious gang that attacked and brutally killed two elderly women, chopped off their feet and looted ornaments has been busted by the police here on Tuesday. Three men have been arrested, who killed the women in April-May last year.    One of the murder had taken place in Baisada Kala at Dabok on April 15 and thereafter the gang members killed another woman in Sakroda, under Pratap Nagar police station area on May 2. "We have arrested Mohan, Bhura and Lalu of Kalbeliya community for having killed 80-year-old Nani Bai and 75-year-old Udi Bai at Baisada Kala and Sakroda respectively."    Udaipur SP, Rajendra Prasad Goyal, gave the details while addressing the media. What came as a surprise even for the cops was that all three men had been interrogated on suspicion after the first murder but they were clever enough to escape the cops then and executed the second murder within a fortnight of the first, Goyal said.    The two incidents in quick succession led to fear and annoyance among people who accused the police for their failure to nab the criminals. "Their modus operandi had been same at both places as they committed the crimes after getting heavily drunk. Since they knew well that old women lived alone at their homes, they fearlessly sneaked in, suffocated them to death and later chopped off their limbs to take out the anklets," additional SP Dr Rajesh Bharadwaj said.    All the three accused are in the age brackets of 22 to 25 years, who did petty jobs for a living but kept watch on elderly women, who lived alone in rural areas. "The accused had mortgaged the ornaments against a loan of Rs 7,000, which they took from one Madan Mehta" additional SP, Anant Kumar said. After nearly 4 months of thorough investigation, different police teams led by Dy SP, Madhuri Verma, SHO Manjit Singh and Badrilal finally were successful to nab the culprits from their hideouts.  ||UDAIPUR

Police have arrested two notorious vehicle lifters, three buyers involved in purchasing the stolen vehicle and two mechanics for tampering with the engine number and giving needed modifications to the stolen vehicles. Police have also seized 13 vehicles from their possession.    In the primary interrogation, the arrested accused accepted their involvement in stealing of almost 30 vehicles, including 25 four-wheelers.    Acting on an information that two notorious vehicle lifters were roaming in the city on Tuesday to steal vehicles, a team constituted by Rahul Jain, deputy commissioner of police (West) apprehended both of them. Their interrogation gave big leads to the police and finally both of them were arrested on the charges of vehicle lifting.    Jain addressing a press conference at the Kardhani police station, said, "The accused Mahaveer has confessed that with the help of the mechanics Babu Lal and Sumer he used to remove the original chassis no of the vehicles. With the help of the grinders, the original engine number and other numbers used in the identification of the vehicle used to be damaged by the gang members."    Police said the vehicle lifters used to steal the vehicles parked outside the marriage lawns. "Before lifting the vehicles, the accused Lalaram and Dinesh had done Reccee," said Jain.    Asked on the specific roles of the accused, Jain said, " Lala and Dinesh were arrested for the vehicle lifting while Mahaveer, Bhawani and Sitaram were arrested for buying the stolen vehicles. Likewise, Babulal and Sumer were the mechanic who used to tamper with the engine numbers and other modifications of the stolen vehicles."    Both Lalaram and Dinesh were also involved in the highway robberies and had undergone imprisonment in Jail for 7 years in a truck loot case.    The accused Mahaveer Prasad who was arrested for purchasing the stolen vehicles was the main accused of a double murder case in 2006.  ||JAIPUR
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Crime-review-meet-delayed/articleshow/48674655.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||Nagpur: The monthly crime review meeting city police to plan strategies and brainstorm lapse could not be held so far this month as top officers remained away on leave. Though a double murder took place and street crimes are on the rise, this is first time after police chief SP Yadav took charge that the meeting was not held so far.  Sources said Yadav was away to attend the half-yearly crime meeting in the first week of the month in Mumbai. The top cop was also unwell during the same period. It was after his return that Addl CP Shrikant Tarwade and Joint CP Rajvardhan too proceeded on leave. Presently, Rajvardhan is in Mumbai to receive the highest honours for meritorious services. "The crime conference has been postponed four times," said an officer.  It is learnt the conference, now rescheduled for later this week, carried much significance as certain instructions regarding the forthcoming Ganpati festival season and other related security issues were to be taken up. Yadav's crime conferences have so far remained replete with fireworks with his lambasting officers for lackadaisical approach and other glitches. "CP minces no words while coming down heavily on the personnel in the crime conferences if he comes across any aberrations," said a senior officer.  Apart from the bandobast, street crimes and property related offences have witnessed an upswing this month. Despite detections, city police have failed to control broad daylight crimes. There had been also repeated allegations against the department for delaying and ignoring complaints.||NAGPUR

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:52 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Crime investigation agency (CIA) in-charge Baljit Singh claimed Gobind Sharma alias Sonu, 25, a resident of Churu in Rajasthan, and Hanish Thakur, 35, a resident of Derabassi in Punjab, were told to stop their car bearing Mohali registration number but instead fired at them. The police retaliated and finally cornered them.    Singh claimed the two were allegedly planning to loot a cash van and kill a jail superintendent.    While Sharma had escaped from jail after he was convicted in a murder case ---- shot dead one Rajesh alias Bobby in Ambala court in 2010, Thakur was booked for murder and under various cases of loot in Haryana, Punjab and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. Police claimed the two had robbed cars in Patiala and were infamous by the name of 'Chhote Baba'.    Deputy commissioner of police Anil Kumar Dhawan said, "The CIA team received information through their sources and arrested the two when they were going to loot a cash van. We have recovered six guns with 140 live cartridges from them."    The police would produce the two in a local court on Wednesday.    Ambala-Panchkula commissioner of police O P Singh said, "The CIA team has done tremendous work and various other cases would be cracked now. Thakur's face is similar to one of the robbers' sketches of the accused who had killed UHBVN cashier after looting Rs 9.50 lakh from him in Industrial Area, Phase II, on August 21."    Cashier killer?    Police suspect Hanish Thakur, 35, one of the accused, could be involved in the Rs 9.5 lakh robbery in which a UHBVN cashier was killed in Panchkula a few days back. Top cops in a press conference at the mini-secretariat said the sketch of the accused based on accounts of eye-witnesses in the robbery could match with the face of Thakur.  ||PANCHKULA

The three were Bhagat Singh, an auto driver, Raj Kumar and Sunita, both from Palsora village in Sector 56.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Raging-kids-put-school-parents-on-edge/articleshow/48674787.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The killing of a 15-year-old class monitor by his fellow students on Monday is proof of the aggression that today marks life in Delhi schools. The situation has become so dire that school officials say they "cannot dismiss" anything as being insignificant, whether it be a stray remark or a squabble and certainly not a fight between students.    To defuse every potentially dangerous situation - ideally before the students choose to settle scores off campus - institutions recruit counsellors who are trained in child psychology. "We can't ignore hostile remarks or threats, however minor," says Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School. "The kids need to know that they can't tell someone 'I'll kill you' even if they don't mean it." She says that it is imperative to resolve differences within the school. "Outside, the school gates, you have no control. You are in a city where people carry baseball bats and guns," she says.    The Indian School has adopted a system of identifying students with volatile temperaments in what it calls pen-picture sessions. "Teachers sit together and discuss the behaviour of each child," explains Joshi "The counsellor is normally present, and we take help from sports teachers too." The effort is to channelise the energies of the youngsters in the right direction, perhaps through sports activities. Ameeta Mohan, principal, Amity International, Pushp Vihar, too says the minds of the children must be kept engaged.    While murderous violence is fairly rare, low-key aggression is common among school kids. A principal requesting not to be identified talked of a Class IX student, who, after a growth spurt, stood over six feet tall and used his stature to intimidate other students - even seniors - into parting with their lunch.    Teachers say that giving such troublemakers roles of responsibility often helps. "You can't yell. Find ways to engage them," says Mohan. However, Ashok Pandey, principal of Ahlcon International School, argues this might not be the right approach. "Positions like a class monitor has no place in our education management system," he says. "Things are changing and you can't put one child ahead of the others." Rather, it is more important for teachers to understand and address the emotional outbursts of difficult students.    Mohan advises parents to talk to their children every evening about what they did in school that day. School principals also concur on the need to counsel parents to react responsibly to a child's anger. Instead of taking "a one sided view" - their child's view - they should take time to arrive at a judgement and "be mindful of the fact that the other party is also a child". Blindly supporting the kid would only aggravate his or her sense of being right and thus lead to aggressive means of settling differences.  ||NEW DELHI

The deceased, identified as Asha Rani, had put up a makeshift rakhi stall near Yashoda College, as she did every year. A resident of Tatheri Wali Galli located off Victoria Street, Asha went to sleep on a cot next to the stall on Monday night. Her house is also located a few metres away from the stall. On Tuesday morning, Asha's daughter Alka found her lying in a pool of blood.    Asha's clothes were in a disarray and blood was oozing out of her face and ears. Signs of struggle were visible around the corpse. Rani's saree had holes and the sheet she used to cover herself with was found near the cot. Ruling out sexual violence, police said a drug addict may have killed the woman for money.    Rani had two sons, Vimal and Pawan, apart from her daughter. Vimal ran a betel nut shop in Bazarkhala, while Pawan had a private job and worked in Mumbai. Looking at her condition, family of the deceased maintained that the assailants had tried to disrobe her and killed her when she resisted. Postmortem report confirmed that Asha had been smothered to death.    Police have rounded up four persons and were grilling one of them till late Tuesday. Circle officer of Chowk area DySP Sarvesh Mishra said, "We have picked up some local persons addicted to substance abuse for questioning and would release them in some time.

Jugde A S Shende sentenced Arif Shaikh (22), Raju Jaiswal (22) and Milind Tayade (23) to life imprisonment.    The incident came to light around 10.30am on January 1, 2014, when a few pavement dwellers found the woman's body, which bore severe head injuries, near the BEST bus depot in Ghatkopar (E). The Pant Nagar police initially registered a case of accidental death, but later converted it into an FIR after the post-mortem report showed that the victim was raped and may have been killed to destroy evidence. The victim moved house on several occasions in Ghatkopar for about seven years, while her 26-year-old son, also a ragpicker, lived with his family in Mumbra. The son occasionally visited his mother and would give her money.    The prosecution examined 13 witnesses in court.The case was based on circumstantial evidence. One of the witnesses told the court that the unemployed accused would trouble the victim on several occasions. He and another witness said that the youths would often get drunk and sleep next to her on the footpath. Another witness testified that they would trouble the victim for money. The three youths were spotted near the bus depot around 1am and the post-mortem report corroborated the time of the incident to the presence of the accused at the crime spot. All these circumstances had led to their arrest. The victim was found with nine injuries on her body. She was subjected to unnatural sex and was assaulted with a huge stone.    On October 28, 2014, the same court had rejected the bail plea of one of the accused while calling the incident "heinous".            ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Shubham-died-as-school-didnt-rein-in-bullies-says-father/articleshow/48674520.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: Shubham Jindal may have been alive today had his school taken his complaints about two class bullies seriously. That's what his father, Anil Jindal, a small-time shopkeeper in southwest Delhi's Chhawla area, believes.    Shubham meant the world to Anil. The 14-year-old was a promising student. Not only was he good at studies but also-rare for a teenage boy in that area-well-behaved. He was made class monitor but the bullies couldn't accept this. They lived in the same neighbourhood and had bothered Shubham over seats in the classroom last year too. Now, every time he complained against them, they came to blows. Anil says the school was aware of the problem but didn't deal with it.    "He didn't want to be the class monitor. Every day, he came home and cried and seemed depressed. It was always about fights at school," said Anil. The family complained and the principal assured them of strict action against the bullies. But their "action" proved counterproductive.    The mother of a boy about whom Shubham had complained thrice to his teacher was summoned to school. She heard out the teacher and then beat up her son in the classroom. The boy resented the public humiliation but his anger was directed at Shubham. A few days later he planned the brutal attack with a classmate, and on Sunday the two led Shubham into a trap where he was beaten up fatally.    Last year, when the three boys were in Class VIII, they had fought over seats. "We visited the principal and the teachers and the matter was resolved. After that we had asked his class teacher to keep an eye on those who bullied him," Anil said, adding that the principal even told Shubham he could come to her house to complain if anyone bullied him.    While the school has maintained silence on Shubham's murder, police on Tuesday said an outsider was involved in the attack. "Two of Shubham's classmates planned the attack. They brought him to the spot where they planned to beat him, and then one of them fled. The other boy and his cousin beat up Shubham," said a senior police official.    Seeing Shubham collapse into a lifeless, bloody heap, the duo fled to a relative's house in Rukhi Village, Sonipat. Around midnight, they shifted to another place in Gohana Tehsil of the same district. They were caught on Monday when they came to pick up their bicycles that they had hidden near the crime scene.    Shubham's family has alleged that the accused's parents tried to cover up their tracks as the boys on their own could not have changed locations. "Police have also acted carelessly in dismissing the involvement of the other boy," Anil said. Police are yet to record the statements of the school principal and teachers in the case.  ||NEW DELHI

With assembly election round the corner, discussion about deteriorating law and order situation, return of 'jungle raj' in Bihar after the JD(U) joined hands with RJD of Lalu Prasad has once against taken the centre stage.    IMA Academy of Medical Specialties (Bihar chapter) chairman and advisor to Bihar State Health Services Association, Dr. Ajay Kumar, admits that a large number of doctors in Bihar have started fearing for 'wasuli raj'. "Violence against medical practitioners is prevalent worldwide. But it is for the local administration to deal with it. Not all doctors are rich and not every day a doctor couple is kidnapped in Bihar (Gaya-based doctor couple was kidnapped and rescued from Lucknow recently). The criminals know that kidnapping is a risky job. So, they want 'protection money (wasuli)' from practising doctors on regular basis. The amount increases on election eve," he said, admitting, "Fear psychosis is definitely there after the RJD-JD(U) alliance."    But Confederation of Indian Industry (Bihar chapter) chairman S P Sinha disagrees. "I think people are giving undue importance to deteriorating law and order situation. We have been apparently working in a peaceful environment for the last few years though some kidnapping and extortion cases took place. Leadership makes all the difference," he said.    Talking about crime against women, social activist Kanchanbala said, "Does any party portray a woman as its leader or face? Most political parties give tickets to the wives of jailed criminals to gain women voters' sympathy. Jungle raj-part 2 is yet to come but what about the crime committed against women in the last ten years. There is no point in blaming one party (RJD)."    RTI activist and Nagrik Adhikar Manch (Bihar) president Shiv Prakash Rai said, "Nine RTI activists have been killed between 2008 and 2015 in different parts of Bihar. What 'sushashan' we are talking about? Look at the recent transfer-postings of bureaucrats. The state government is using caste-based postings to mobilize voters in respective constituencies. If CM Nitish Kumar wants, he can work for the better of Bihar. The crime data shows good or bad governance. On an average, around 3,000 murders took place in Bihar every year between 2001 and 2014."    Bihar was notorious since mid-70s for lawlessness, caste wars and massacres. Kidnapping for ransom emerged the major enterprise between 1990 and 2004. The state police recorded 24,340 kidnapping for ransom cases between 1992 and 2001. While 1,995 cases of kidnapping for ransom were lodged between 2002 and 2012, 165 such cases were reported from 2013 to June, 2015.    ||

The girl stays with her kin at Shakthinagar and has been working in the super market since two years.     Regarding the Monday's incident, she claimed Shakir used force to get her into the car near Babugudde and when she screamed, bystanders had come and rescued her. She also alleged that Shakir was threatening that he had the video of her sitting in the car and prayed to the police to retrieve it and destroy it.     Later talking to media, she claimed that she was not aware that he was beaten and who had assaulted him. Further she said Shakir deserved a thrashing and offered sympathies to the goons who assaulted and humiliated him. Regarding Shakir's claims that she has asked for money, the 21 year old girl claimed that her situation was not so bad that she needed money from others.     Regarding the girl's complaint, police officials said that they will investigate and proceed accordingly. "We will try to get the facts right. Anyway the victim of assault is recuperating in the hospital which will give us time to ascertain facts of the compliant and the veracity," said a police official.     ||MANGALURU

The incident has led to a massive outrage with locals demanding tough action against the accused. An FIR has been lodged at Jarifnagar police station in Badaun by her family. However, police termed the incident an accident.     According to reports, Durvesh Kumari (28), who is a resident of Karanpur Bhur village under Ughaiti police station, was going to her parents' home along with her nephew Neeraj on a motorcycle on Monday. Her three children â€” Vikas (5), Shalini (7) and one-and-a-half year old Chhaya â€” also accompanied them.     The family members of the woman claimed that once they reached Ramnagar road, which falls between Nadha and Kotha villages under Jarifnagar police station, two assailants riding on a motorcycle snatched Durvesh's earrings. When the woman tried to raise an alarm, the duo reportedly pushed her from the speeding motorcycle causing severe injuries to Durvesh.

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU

"It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:16:57 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Police said the girl's body was found on August 22. On August 13, her brother had filed a complaint about his missing sister.     For solving the case, police checked CCTV footage in the area and took three youths â€” Imran, a resident of Chandinagar, Akbar of Khekra (Baghpat) and another Akbar of Ahiran (Baghpat) â€” in custody and interrogated them.     SP Vijay Bhushan said that Imran had confessed he was in a relationship with the girl in Basi Chundhiyari village and had asked her to elope with him. He had asked her to bring along jewellery and money.     However, he told police that she had brought very little from home, which angered him. He had then, along with his friends, raped her and strangled her, before throwing her body into the jungle.     The SP also announced an award of Rs 5,000 for the team, which solved the case.     ||MEERUT

He told cops that he had information about the murder of Sheena Bora in 2012 and could lead them to the murderer as well as the victim's body.Khar police picked up Mukerjea's driver, Shinoy Roy, a few days ago, and based on this information, started grilling him, upon which he confessed to having murdered Bora at Mukerjea's behest. He also told the cops that he dumped Bora's body in the forests of Raigad (in the Konkan region of Maharashtra). Mumbai police got in touch with their counterparts in Raigad, who confirmed that the remains of an unknown woman had been found at the same spot in 2012.The police then arrested the driver, and on the strength of his confession, asked Mukerjea to present herself for questioning on Tuesday. She was arrested after being interrogated for three hours.Both Mukerjea and her driver were produced in the Bandra Metropolitan Magistrate's court on Tuesday and were remanded in police custody till August 31. They have been booked under Sections 302 (murder), 363 (kidnapping) and 201 (destroying evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.Senior officials said Roy had told interrogators that the two sisters fell out over a property or financial dispute. More details would emerge after they interrogated Mukerjea, who herself was a top executive in a television channel, officials said.Sources connected to the probe said they had proceeded very cautiously and questioned the driver for two days before picking up Mukerjea. "We will interrogate and find out more about the motive and how the body was disposed of," an officer at Khar police station said. Officials, however, said there could be problems during the trial stage as the skeletal remains were disposed of without collecting any DNA sample.In 2009, the Mukerjeas promoted INX Media, which operated 9X, a Hindi general entertainment channel, 9XM, music channel, and NewsX, a news channel. Indrani was CEO while her husband was chairman. They stepped down in 2009.||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Soviet-WWII-plane-Jewish-tombstones-found-in-Polish-rivers/articleshow/48670976.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||WARSAW: As Polish river levels fall to record lows amid a prolonged drought, the material remains of Poland's tortured 20th-century history are coming to light on newly exposed riverbeds, with Jewish tombstones and the human remains of Soviet fighter pilots and their plane being found in recent days.     Those discoveries follow that of stone fragments from the early 20th-century Poniatowski Bridge across the Vistula River in Warsaw which the Germans blew up in 1944 as they crushed the Warsaw Uprising.     "The Vistula River is hiding no end of secrets. They are everywhere,'' said Jonny Daniels, the head of Jewish foundation ``From the Depths,'' who waded into a shallow area of the Vistula on Tuesday, picking up fragments of stones with Hebrew lettering.     For the most part, officials knew that archaeological remnants remained hidden under wild and murky waters of the Vistula River or its tributaries. But it was simply impossible to carry out searches for them until now. Amid a prolonged drought, the Vistula, which flows 1,047 kilometers (651 miles) from the Beskidy Mountains to the Baltic Sea, is at its lowest level since measurements started in the late 18th century _ leading explorers and fortune-hunters to comb riverbanks across the country.     On Sunday, explorers found the remnant of the Soviet fighter-bomber plane in the Bzura River, a tributary of the Vistula, near the village of Kamion in central Poland. The pieces have been moved to a museum in nearby Wyszogrod for examination, with more recovery work planned for Saturday.     The head of the museum, Zdzislaw Leszczynski, told The Associated Press that parts of Soviet uniforms, a parachute, a sheepskin coat collar, parts of boots, a pilot's personal TT pistol and radio equipment were found, along with a lot of heavy ammunition. The inscriptions on the control panel and on the radio equipment are in Cyrillic.     The uncovered remnants are part of the larger story of a devastating war that played out across Poland from 1939-1945: a German invasion from the west, a Soviet invasion from the east, the murder of Jews across occupied Poland and fighting between the Soviets and Germans after Adolf Hitler turned on former ally Josef Stalin.     Leszczynski said that witnesses had described the plane being hit while flying low in January 1945 and crashing down through the thick ice and into the river. At that time in the area, the German army was retreating toward Berlin before the Red Army's advance.     "Until now, the water level did not allow for the search and there was no one willing to enter this swamp,'' he said.     Russian Embassy spokeswoman Valeria Perzhinskaya said she considers the discovery important and believes the crew could be identified by the numbers on the wreckage and could be properly buried. About 600,000 Soviet troops were killed fighting the German army on Polish territory.     The Jewish tombstones that were found in Warsaw are believed to come from the Brodno cemetery in Warsaw's Praga district. Once the resting place of 300,000 Jews, only 3,000 tombstones remain there today; the rest were removed during and after the war and used as building materials and to reinforce the river's banks.     Two weeks ago, a man walking along the river in Warsaw came across fragments of the tombstones with Hebrew lettering and took Daniels there on Tuesday. In the meantime, some had already been removed, though a few fragments were still lying on the riverbed. Now Daniels hopes to take students there to do a more thorough search and return anything he can find to the cemetery.     "Jewish history is buried in the Vistula," he said.||WARSAW

MP has recorded 3,778 IPC crimes in 2014, up from 3,429 a year earlier.As per recently released National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, state ranks fourth in IPC crimes reported by government railway police (GRP) with 3,778 such incidences alone in 2014, accounting for around 10% of railway crimes in the country, placing it notches below Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, which have registered 5,585 and 5,158 cases, respectively. The number of crimes in railways across the country has been recorded as 36,466.While, former was at top last year, this year has seen West Bengal ace the dubious list with 6,347 IPC crimes, a jump of around 325% from last year's figure of 1,494.Closer home, in Madhya Pradesh, almost 80% railway crimes reported were thefts (3,013) while there were 61 robberies and 15 burglary cases as well. Besides, 11 rapes, 8 murders, 6 attempt to murder and 45 cases of kidnappings and abductions have also occurred in MP in railways.Number of crimes in railways in the state steadily increased over last three years. While it was 2,409 in 2011, it shot up to 2,831 in 2012, registering an increase of 17.5% in incidences of crimes. In 2013, it had jumped 21.1% to 3,429 cases. In 2014, there was an increase of more than 10% crimes reported by GRP.Railway Protection Force (RPF) is meant for protecting railway properties, passenger areas and passengers though it has limited police powers, which are mainly vested with the GRP for which railways bears half the cost. However, dual responsibility system, involving GRP and RPF triggered problems for railways in providing seamless security to passengers, railway officials said.There are cases of passengers not being able to lodge complaints of theft or other crime incidents because of state boundary issues, official said.Crime in railways touched a new high with 392 cases of murder, 122 of rape, 440 of kidnapping and abduction, 1,128 of robbery, 80 of dacoity and 22,477 theft cases reported from across India in 2014.||BHOPAL

In 2013, the number of such cases was 1,123, which nearly doubled to 2,196 last year.    Although the state did not report any case relating to purchase or sale of girl children for prostitution last year, cases of rape and abduction were high. About 755 minor girls were raped in Odisha last year up from 509 in 2013. A total of 802 children were kidnapped in 2014 while the figure stood at 366 in 2013.    "Almost all the rapes and abductions were committed by close acquaintances or relatives of the rape survivors. Most of the cases were reported from slum areas," said a police officer. "The abduction cases relate to elopement by minor girls," the officer said.    Crimes against children occurred unabated in Odisha's capital city as well. Official statistics said 43 minor girls were allegedly raped in Bhubaneswar last year compared to 27 in 2013 and two in 2012, indicating the vulnerability of minor girls to crimes.    The arrest of an auto-rickshaw driver here on December 10, 2014, on charges of molesting a minor girl was the most sensational. The 17-year-old girl from Jajpur had come to a private university near Jatni to take admission for a vocational course on tailoring when the driver gave her lift and molested her. She jumped off the auto-rickshaw and was rescued by some locals.    On December 28, 2014, the parents of a 10-year-old girl from Saliasahi lodged a complaint with Mahila police station alleging that some men forcibly engaged her in prostitution. Police arrested seven persons.    "In many cases, the accused got a clean chit in court due to poor investigation by the police. And in some cases, victims and their families turned hostile, leading to the acquittal of the accused. The government should strengthen the Mahila and Sishu desks at police stations and improve infrastructure in courts to ensure speedy trials," said Anuradha Mohanty, a child rights sactivist.

These were the men who loved India and Indians and went way beyond their call of duty when doing in India and for India what they did.Arther Thomas Cotton, considered all time great engineers of the British empire, in 1958 dared to dream of an ambitious project to link all the major Indian rivers to exploit the full irrigation and navigational potential in the country.Cotton is the man known as 'Bhageeratha' in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and has more than 3000 statues of him installed all over East and West Godavari districts for his work in the region, the book says.Ask a hundred educated people who set up the Asiatic Society and chances are 99 will draw a blank. "And therein lies the need of telling these stories, which, in our view, are stories of sheer human spirit, stories of excellence, perseverance and application, stories that celebrate the satisfaction of a job well done", the authors say.The book says few would imagine that an East India Company official well-versed in Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Chinese would turn Indologist mid-life, go on to Sanskrit and translate Kalidasa's Shankutalam, Ritusamhara and Manusamhita into English and then set up The Asiatic Society.It was Sir William Jones Jr. who in 1784 registered the Asiatic Society with objective of advancing Asiatic research.India is home to some of the grandest and most ancient monuments in the world that have withstood the test of time, invasions and general apathy.It was Alexander Cuningham of Bengal Engineers regiment who put a proposal for constitution of Archaeological Survey.Perhaps his most important contribution is the restoration of the temple at Bodh Gaya, the legendary site of Buddha's enlightenment.When he first visited the site the only visible relic of an ancient empire was buried under centuries of sand, the book says.William Henry Sleeman was the civil servant who rid India of dacoit gangs known as 'thugs'. One of his first official proclamations when posted in Jabalpur was regarding prohibition of 'Sati'.When his soldiers began to fall prey to highway robberies, Sleeman went on to make series of arrests.He built a special prison to hold the swelling number of prisoners. As a deterrent, the ones who had committed the most gruesome murders were publicly hanged, the book says. There is a village-Sleemanabad- in Madhya Pradesh, a tribute to the man's work, the book says.||

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Sheena-docu-Michail-add-to-mystery/articleshow/48701752.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||GUWAHATI: The persistent silence of Michail, Sheena's younger brother, on the identity of their biological father and the manner in which his sister's birth certificate was registered have raised a number of unanswered questions.    Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Two days after his mother Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Mikhail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed what he gave the police was enough to prove Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora, who are actually Indrani's parents, as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. However, many questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter. In many cases in India involving single mothers, grandparents are known to put in their names as father and mother.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target.

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.

The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:02 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

This climate of uncertain loyalties and fatal jealousies made life most difficult for their subordinates - even those drafted unwillingly to do their bidding, like this resourceful but cynical and wise-cracking ex-policeman.In his tenth outing, Philip Kerr's irrepressible Bernie Gunther is summoned by no one less than the Third Reich's Truth and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels (known by the irreverent Berliners as "Joey the Crip (ple)" due to his clubfoot and Mahatma Propagandhi for his job) on a mission. This is nothing new for Gunther, who has already (most unwillingly) worked for Reichmarshal Herman Goering, Reinhard 'Hangman' Heydrich, Heinrich 'Gestapo' Muller and so on.But this mission is different - and one which will impinge Gunther in ways he cannot imagine. It appears simple - locating the father of an actress who is the rising star of German cinema and Goebbels himself is keen upon. But the missing man hails from Yugoslavia, which is so scarred by sectarian divides and killings that even Gunther, who thinks he is used to violence at its height or depravity at its lowest, is unnerved at what is going on there. He does find the missing man but the reality is unpalatable.Returning back to Berlin and reporting to Goebbels, he is now tasked with going to neutral Switzerland where the actress is and tasked with cajoling her back to Germany. As usual, he is given a few other tasks and these prove to be more potentially lethal, while soon the worlds of both his commissions soon collide with devastating consequences for all concerned.Nazi Germany's equally jaded and world weary equivalent of tarnished noir heroes like Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade, Gunther was however once an homicide detective in Berlin police, before drafted again into government service in the high tide of Nazi rule. He originally starred in three novels - March Violets (1989), set in the early years of Nazi rule, The Pale Criminal (1990) set in a time when its murderous contours were fairly evident, and A German Requiem (1991), set in Cold War Vienna where it refers to the shooting of Orson Welles' epic The Third Man and also replicates its plot. (The three were published together as Berlin Noir, 1993)Kerr, who has scores of other books as well as a popular children's series, resurrected him in The One From the Other (2006) and since then there has a fresh adventure every year or every second year, focussing on various parts of his life before, during and after the war, and not only in his homeland or other parts of Europe but also Peron's Argentina, Battista's Cuba (with the Castro revolt on), a Soviet POW camp and the like.Adding a real feel of the gritty adventures are the cameos by various real personalities - apart from the Nazi bigwigs. In this book only, we run into Kurt Waldheim, latter to be UN secretary general and Austrian president, Allen Dulles, a latter CIA chief but then its predecessor OSS' chief in Switzerland and the notorious Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj-Amin Husseini, who even raised a formation of Bosnian Muslim volunteers for the SS (most of them balked at the work they were expected to do, mutinied and were shot or imprisoned!)Gunther's foray into Yugoslavia also reveals why the multi-ethnic country witnessed some of the most unconscionable fighting and massacres ever seen in peaceful, civilised Europe even decades afterwards.And for those allured by the sardonic, tough-talking hero with a rough sense of humour and honour, a new adventure is also due next year!||

Shiva was arrested in September 2010 by the Ahmedabad crime branch.     Shiva had contested the municipal polls in 2013 as a BJP candidate while he was in prison and emerged victorious. He had contested from ward nine of Kodinar municipality and campaigned while sitting in jail.     He is nephew of former BJP MP from Junagadh Dinu Solanki, who is also an accused in Jethava murder case.     Shiva was the president of Kodinar municipality before he was arrested. A special CBI court had granted bail to Shiva Solanki last year. The CBI court had granted bail to Solanki after he furnished bail bond of Rs 5 lakh, along with other routine conditions imposed on him.     BJP had won all 27 seats in Kodinar municipality elections in 2013. This was BJP's third consecutive victory in Kodinar municipal polls.     RTI activist Jethava was shot dead near Gujarat High Court in July 2010. Ahmedabad Crime Branch had arrested six persons in the case, including Shiva and sharp shooter Sailesh Pandya, who had allegedly fired at Jethava.     Jethava had filed several petitions in the HC against the forest department along with public interest litigations (PIL) on illegal mining in Gir forests of Junagadh district, which is considered the last abode of Asiatic lions in the world.     Jethava's father Bikha Jethava approached the HC stating that the police had not probed involvement of Dinu Solanki in the murder. In September 2012, the HC had ordered CBI probe in the case. CBI later included Dinu Solanki as accused in murder of Jethava.     ||RAJKOT

The floral crown that is put on the deity every evening is made by prisoners at the district jail.    Seven prisoners are engaged in making the special crown using different varieties of flowers. The batch changes every month and every prisoner gets the chance to "serve the Lord". Armed guards take the crown to the temple complex before shringar puja every evening.    "The exact origin of this practice and its reason remains untraceable," said Mrityunjay Tiwari, the jailor. "It can be safely said that the custom dates back to the colonial era and has been that way ever since," he added.    The process of making the crown begins in the afternoon. The inmates tasked with the job take bath and wear clean clothes before starting work.    "Great care is taken while making it (the crown). Once done, they hand it over to the guards at the transit point," jail superintendent Ashutosh said.    The crown is then kept at the Shiva temple adjoining the prison complex. The priest at the temple on the jail premises, accompanied by two sentinels, carry the crown on foot to the temple, chanting 'Bol Bam' all the way.    Most of those who make the tiara are hardened criminals. While a few are accused of rape, others are under trial for heinous crime like murder and dacoity. "In exchange of their work, they are paid Rs 100 each daily," Tiwari said.    The jail authorities claim the flowers are sometimes sent in first class coaches by anonymous devotees from Kolkata and other towns. "The flowers used for making the crown are provided by devotees. We have them from all parts of the country," said Kartik Pandey, the priest at the prison temple.    Many prisoners feel this is a way to serve the almighty. "By serving the lord, we try our best of penance," said an undertrial criminal who has been jailed for murdering his wife.    ||DEOGHAR

The police have rounded up the driver of the vehicle and efforts are on to trace the owner for questioning him.     The officials terming the action to be a 'preventive' one stated that the 13 calves were allegedly being transported to a slaughter house in Sillikhana.     Qayyum Khan Ayyub Khan Pathan, the driver of the vehicle that was carrying the calves has been arrested, while the police are on the hunt for two others. One of those absconding had bought the cattle from Vadodbazar while another is allegedly the owner of the vehicle that was transporting the animals.     Harsul police station chief, inspector Wasim Hashmi said that a constable, Kailas Kale, on suspicion signalled a pick-up van coming to the city from Vadodbazaar to stop. The driver ignored the signal and continued driving after which Kale chased him on a motorcycle and intercepted the vehicle at Harsul T-point.     He, along with the vehicle, was brought to the police station and five female and eight male calves were rescued. A case was registered against the driver, vehicle owner and the cattle owner. Constabulary staff of the police station, Kalyan Chabukswar, Syed Babar, Borse, and a couple of women officials from the Charlie squad assisted the police, Hashmi added.     Earlier, the Harsul police on August 11 had arrested three people on the charges of carrying 13 bulls for selling them off to butchers in Sillikhana area of the city.     The accused trio, along with six of their suspected associates, has been slapped with the sections under Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, 1995. One of the accused has also been slapped with attempt to murder charges for allegedly trying to run over a cop, who tried to intercept the vehicle carrying the animals.     Harsul police inspector Wasim Hashmi said that the cops from his police station were carrying out their routine nakabandi in their jurisdictions when they learnt about two vehicles carrying bullocks for selling them to abattoirs. Based on his information, a team was sent and the bulls were seized.     The Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act was sanctioned by the President in February 2015 and notified in March by the state government. The law bans the slaughter of bulls and bullock, along with the earlier ban on slaughter of cows.     Anyone found to be selling beef or in possession of beef can be jailed for five years and fined Rs 10,000. Section 5 D makes it a criminal and cognisable offence to possess beef, even if the animal is slaughtered outside Maharashtra where it is legally permissible, punishable with a jail term of up to one year.||AURANGABAD

The woman and her three daughters aged 12, 11 and seven attempted to pour kerosene on themselves in front of Inspector general of police's office at 10am.     A police team reacted quickly and managed to grab the can of kerosene from the woman. Police took them to the Thirukkanur police station for inquiries.     The woman alleged that her neighbour M Arumugam, 46, a grocery shop owner at Lingareddipalayam who was accused of raping her 10-year-old daughter, started threatening her, her husband and daughters demanding that they withdraw the case. Arumugam was arrested in August last year and got bail recently.     "A gang of rowdies approached me offering money to withdraw the case. When I refused they started threatening me for three consecutive days (August 7, 8 and 9). They even roped in my supervisor (Jipmer) to press me to concede to their demand. I flatly refused," said the woman, who has been working on contract in Jipmer.     She sent written complaints to IGP, Thirukkanur and Katterikuppam police stations on August 12. The gang approached her again on August 21 threatening to murder her if she didn't withdraw the case. Irked over frequent threats and police inaction, the woman along with three daughters attempted to commit suicide.     A police officer said Arumugam offered soft drinks to the minor girl when she came to his shop to buy milk and sexually abused her on July 22 last year. Police booked Arumugam under Section 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) of Pocso and Sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian penal code (IPC) and arrested him in August last year after her parents sent representations to the national commission for child rights and child welfare committee.     Child welfare committee chairperson Vidyaa Ramkumar said the case, which came for hearing before a Puducherry court on August 11, was adjourned to next month. Superintendent of police (rural) V Deivasigamani said he had directed the D Nagar police to probe the incident and register a case.     The victim's family also alleged that there were repeated threats to the witnesses in the case to prevent them from appearing before the court. A gang torched the house of N Valli, one of the witnesses, for refusing to abstain from appearing before the court in August last year. Police registered a case under Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) and began investigations.     ||PUDUCHERRY

A complainant in a custodial murder case of Jamkhambhalia has requested the Mirzapur rural court not to release Bhatt's passport. Bhatt had sought the court's permission to travel to UK.The dismissed cop had surrendered his passport, when he was granted bail in October 2011 in connection with an offence registered with Ghatlodia police by Bhatt's former subordinate K D Panth for allegedly forcing him to file an affidavit. Bhatt allegedly wanted to establish that he had gone to then chief minister Narendra Modi's residence on February 27, 2002. This was after Bhatt had alleged that Modi had asked police officials to go slow on rioters.Earlier this month, Bhatt sought custody of his passport for two months - from August 30 to October 30 - from the Mirzapur rural court so that he could travel to UK to help his daughter who has secured admission to a postgraduate course at Oxford University. His daughter, Dr Akashi Bhatt, is to commence her post graduation in clinical embryology in the Department of Obstetrics and Genecology from October 5.To Bhatt's surprise, Amrut Vaishnani, one of the complainants in the 1990 Jamkhambhaliya case in which Bhatt and six other cops are facing trial, filed an objection application. The seven accused are being tried for murder, causing harm, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, criminal intimidation and abetment. Amrut's relative Prabhudas Vaishnani had died allegedly due to renal failure a few days after he was detained and beaten in police custody. Bhatt was an assistant superintendent of police in Jamkhambhalia when communal violence erupted there.Vaishnani's counsel Parth Divyeshvar said that the case against Bhatt has been pending for 25 years despite repeated high court orders to expedite the proceedings.He submitted that he wanted to put this to court's notice that if Bhatt is granted permission to travel abroad, the trial in Jamkhambhalia too will get affected. And hence, Bhatt should not be given his passport.||AHMEDABAD
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/400-booked-for-killing-man-in-Kolhapur-village/articleshow/48660918.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||KOLHAPUR: The unidentified man brutally beaten up last week by Phulewadi villagers, who were charged up with messages circulating on mobile phone apps about a gang of robbers in their area, succumbed to his injuries on Monday. The police have booked around 400 villagers for murder.     There has been no theft in the area in the past month, the police said, but there have been at least five such cases of innocent people being targeted by villagers. This was the first casualty of the unsubstantiated rumours.     Last Wednesday, an unidentified man with an unkempt appearance was moving around Shinganapur area in Phulewadi, Kolhapur, when a group of around 400 villagers beat him up and inflicted serious head injuries on him. The police had intervened and admitted him to Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital in Kolhapur. On Friday night, he was shifted to Sasoon hospital, Pune. He died on Monday.     The police now stare at the Herculean task of identifying the 400 villagers they have accused of the crime. "We have CCTV footage of the incident and are busy identifying the people who beat him. We will soon arrest them," said Dayanad Dome, police inspector in-charge of Karveer police station. "We had booked around 400 persons under section 307 of IPC (attempt to murder) for allegedly beating him. Now all of them will be booked under section 302 of IPC."     "We had already issued notices to people in the adjoining villages not to create any law and order problem or patrol at night with sharp weapons. We have warned them that if we find anyone in the night, we will arrest them and take legal action against them," he said.     A few villages adjoining the city and suburban areas have been rife with rumours about a gang of robbers in the vicinity resulting in villagers beating up innocent people. The police have appealed to villagers to not believe the rumours spreading through social media and have also warned them of strict action if they spread such rumours.     The rumours started from Sangli and Satara districts last month and villagers started patrolling at many places.     Sanjay Kumar Verma, inspector general of Kolhapur range, had said that talks of gangs of robbers operating in the rural parts of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts are only rumours. The police have increased patrolling to ensure peace and people need not panic and should not believe these rumours, he had said.||KOLHAPUR

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:08 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

One of the assailants, suffering from sickle cell, unable to cope the tension fainted on the spot.  Following Shendre's interrogation, Nandanvan police under Senior PI Sudhir Nandanwar have arrested the three accomplices. The trio were remanded in custody till August 28 by court on Monday. Shendre's custody has been extended till August 31.  Nandanvan police, which logically took the probe ahead after crime branch arrested Shendre, have recovered around four sharp-edged weapons which were procured from Pachmarhi in Madhya Pradesh. Police said that Shendre used his knife while others merely assisted.  The trio have been identified as Pankaj Akre, Akshay Ghatole and Lakhan Bondre. Sources said Shendre had named only Akre who later revealed the involvement of Ghatole and Bondre too.  Shendre, a diploma holder in engineering, was working as a bouncer at a bar at Nandanvan. One of his sisters is an ayurvedic doctor while another is a homeopath. Police said his father Prabhakar, who took contracts to chop grass, would frequently lament seeing the rapid progress Gautam and Patle were making. In the past, Gautam's father Hemraj used to work as labourer for Prabhakar.  Prabhakar's constant unhappiness over Gautam's progress led to Shendre plotting the plan to eliminate him. Patle had to be killed too as he accompanied his brother-in-law Punatri who was being lured by Shendre to a desolate place.  Shendre had roped in three of his neighbours, Akre, Ghatole and Bondre, requesting them to accompany him to a place where he merely wanted to thrash someone to teach a lesson. Acre, son of a tax recovery officer of Nagpur Municipal Corporation, is a student of commerce stream. Ghatole is suffering from sickle cell. It is learnt that Ghatole was unable to bear the gory sight and fainted.  Shendre had managed to mislead crime branch by claiming to be the sole architect of the murder. The crime branch, which rushed to declare about their 'prized catch' in a hurriedly arranged press conference, later handed over Shendre to Nandanvan police. The Nandanvan police later used Shendre's soft corner for family to extract information regarding the involvement of others and places where they destroyed evidences.  Police said Shendre already has a case of harassment filed by his wife. He had destroyed the cell phone having the SIM card used for calling Gautam. Shendre had been using the SIM card only to speak to his women friends.  HOW the MASTERMIND fell apart  1. Nandanvan police noticed that Ankush Shendre had a deep respect for his father Prabhakar and that he was protective about family  2. The investigating team built pressure on Shendre by threatening to book family members including father  3. The police team had also started for Shendre's residence posing as if they were ready to bring the rest of the family members to name them in the case  4. Shendre stopped the police from visiting his place by naming Akre who spilled the beans  5. Shendre later helped police to recover the blood smeared knife and also took them to the other places where he had concealed rest of the evidence||NAGPUR

According to the police, the deceased identified as Kamlesh(age not known) was into a dispute over a piece of land with some of his distant relatives. Earlier too both the confronting groups were at loggerheads and police had intervened to restore peace among them. During wee hours at least six assailants came and attacked the family of Kamlesh and thrashed them with sticks and iron rods. "There were unconfirmed reports that the assailants also brought swords for the attack," said a senior police officer.    After the attack the victim Kamlesh was seriously injured and two other family members were also injured. "He (Kamlesh) was rushed to the nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. Two other persons were injured in the incident were undergoing treatment at the hospital," officer added.    Police have registered a case of murder against at least six unidentified persons and have launched a massive hunt to nab the assailants. "We have got clues on their whereabouts as we have also detained a few of their relatives. We will certainly make arrests in this murder case," the officer added.    After the attack tension prevailed in the area and police was deployed near the house of the victim family.  ||JAIPUR

Considering it to be an honour killing case, the police have launched an investigation. The cousin made the disclosure at a hospital where he was admitted after he apparently attempted suicide by consuming some poisonous substance.    A police officer said the man, identified as Budhha Ram, is a resident of Basita Wali Chowki in Hanumangarh's Talwada area. His cousin sister Seema Kumari had gone missing on January 19.    "A missing person's report was registered with the police on January 27. The father had reported that she went missing from her house. It was not clear why the missing report was registered eight days after the girl's disappearance," said the officer.    He said that the police had tried to trace the girl, but didn't succeed.    "On Sunday night, Seema's cousin Buddha Ram was admitted to a hospital in nearby Sriganganagar town. The relatives said that he had consumed pesticide," said the officer.    He added that many cases of farmers being brought to hospital in an unconscious state when they inhale pesticides while farming are reported, so initially it was believed that it was one such case. But later, it came up that the man had consumed poison intentionally.    Buddha Ram was drifting in and out of consciousness. He told his friends and medical staff present at the hospital that he had pushed Seema into a canal with help of a family member.    "We were informed about the disclosure following which a team was rushed to the hospital. However, when the police reached there, he was not in a condition to speak," said the officer.    "Based on what we were told by his friends and the medical staff, we have launched an investigation into the possibility that Seema was murdered. It has been eight months so it may be not possible to recover the body, but we have deputed a police team at the hospital to record Budhha Ram's statement as soon as he gains consciousness," said the officer.    He added they were also trying to find out about the family member who had reportedly helped Budhha Ram in killing the girl. "He didn't disclose his accomplice's name," said the officer.  ||JAIPUR

Kavlekar also instructed the prosecution to issue fresh summons to main accused Fr Romano Gonsalves, who was absent during the court hearing. She said that the police had failed to return the summons. The former Velim parish priest Fr Gonsalves is presently in USA and is expected to arrive on August 26.    Kavlekar ordered the prosecution to ask the investigating officer (IO) to take remedial measures as some accused complained to the court of their names being misspelled.    The case is now scheduled for October 5 at 10am. While advocate Pritam Morais appeared on behalf of Gonsalves, advocate Rajeev Gomes represented the remaining 21 accused in the case. Assistant public prosecutor Shilpa Nagvenkar represented the state. Velim MLA Bejamin Silva along with his supporters were present in court.    When Kavlekar said she would later transfer the case to the sessions court, Gomes said, "The government is planning to withdraw the case." Gomes also sought exemption for his client, former Assolna parish priest Fr Lucio Dias, who is presently the South Goa episcopal vicar.    The 22 accused, Frs Dias and Gonsalves, Louis Fernandes, Agnelo D'Silva, Adlete Mascarenhas, Max Colaco, Savio Pereira, Angelo Fernandes, Atorin Pereira, Alin Rebello, Mario Rebello, Tony Rebello, Adolfo Fernandes, Marcus Barros, Agnelo D'Souza, Nelson Caeiro, Nigel Caeiro, Savio Silva, Agnelo Silva, Angelo Afonso, Darwin D'Silva and Patrick D'Silva have all been charged for allegedly forming an unlawful assembly with deadly weapons such as stones and glass bottles.    They are also charged for assaulting and pelting stones at the police personnel, who were discharging their lawful duties of rescuing CID policemen comprising PSI Kapil Nayak, HC Krishnanand Rane and PC Kuldip Dessai.    The trio had visited the church to obtain intelligence inputs on whether the voters of Velim would be voting in the 2012 assembly elections or not but were allegedly confined within the church premises. PSI Sandeep Kesarkar and other CRPF jawans were injured in the mob attack.    ||MARGAO

Bhau Nausu Wagh, a resident of Mokhada, was accused of attacking Shankar Wagh using a wooden log reportedly following a fight over property that resulted in his death on March 8, 2013.    District judge R R Gandhi went through the 7/12 documents which was jointly in their names. Also, the complaint mentioned that the deceased was attacked by a wooden log. However it was a bamboo stick.    The judge, considering several other loopholes in the case, acquitted Wagh as the prosecution failed to prove any offence against him.  ||THANE
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Land-at-root-of-southwest-Delhis-blood-thirst/articleshow/48659911.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: Life is cheap in southwest Delhi. As property prices in Najafgarh, Dwarka, Kanjhawala, Narela, etc continue to shoot up, more than a hundred lives have been lost in gang battles for control of the booming real estate market.Police say half of the gang wars in the area have been fought over property disputes and land-grabbing. All the gangs work to a pattern: first occupying a piece of land and then offering to help the owner recover it for a share in the property.This has been going on for almost two decades, but police seem unable to curb the lawlessness in a culture of clans and vendetta. "This small cluster has defied all norms of public order for more than two decades now. While people in the rest of the city rely on patrol cops and the 100 helpline in crises, here they practise eye-for-an-eye," a policeman who has observed southwest Delhi's gang wars over the years said.Gangs first formed in the area in the early 1990s as a result of the rivalry between two men, Kishan Pehlwan and Balraj. "The tension escalated into a killing spree over issues rooted in land disputes. Even the rivalry between Pehlwan and Balraj arose from a running feud between their families over 12 acres of land," a special cell officer said. "Pehlwan, though, changed the rules of the game as his men allegedly killed Balraj, his brother Anoop and others from the rival group in a span of a few years."The Balraj gang hit back by killing Pehlwan's uncle Rami and some others. But finally Pehlwan prevailed in southwest Delhi through the 90s and the noughties. The feud between these two families also alienated their villages, Mitraon (Balraj) and Dhichau (Pehlwan)."In 2007, Pehlwan became even more powerful as his brother Bharat Singh was elected a municipal councillor. Next year, he became an MLA on an INLD ticket," the officer said. Pehlwan and his wife Neelam were also elected councillors in 2009 after he got arrested.But in the years since Pehlwan's rise land had become too valuable to be controlled by just one gang. New groups were forming, and in 2012, the Anoop gang led by Udaiveer alias Kala made an attempt on Bharat's life. The MLA was wounded but survived. A year later he lost the assembly election setting off the family's decline. The Pehlwan clan was soon reduced to one among many outfits in the Najafgarh area.From 2013 onwards, the gangs got into the protection business, covering landowners who paid them and attacking those who didn't. There was a spate of killings to settle property disputes. The gangsters demanded a share in the new unauthorized colonies that were coming up.Gangs led by Naveen Khati, Ravinder Bholu and others along with Manjeet Mahal, Sandeep Mental and Vikas Langarpuria became active in the area. Older gangsters like Neeraj Bawana, Neetu Dabodia and Manoj Morkheri were already active in the area.As these gangsters and local politicians declared all-out war to capture the real estate business, the area's villages became a ticking bomb. Four youths were murdered on New Year's Eve in 2014 as a result of the rivalry between Naveen Khati and Ravinder Bholu gangs. Pehlwan's brother Bharat Singh was also bumped off. For southwest Delhi's new gang order, bloodshed is no big deal.||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/In-Delhis-underbelly-blood-cheaper-than-water-cable/articleshow/48659878.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: Whether they are investigating a snatching in Vasant Vihar or a robbery in Greater Kailash, the first thing police from the southern range do after registering an FIR is track the movements of gangs from Madangir and Sangam Vihar.    With 90% of bag-lifters and thak-thak gangs-which divert drivers' attention to steal from cars-based in these areas, police have good reason to cast their net there. Even the group that carried out the Lajpat Nagar robbery was from this area, and so was the one involved in Sunday's killing.    The mafia in these areas are fighting to corner low-margin businesses like water supply and cable TV connections. The gangs are ruthless and kill for small amounts, which explains why so many lives have been lost in gang violence. Even innocent people have been killed in cases of mistaken identity or from stray shots.    The area has at least six gangs, each with 29-30 men and juveniles. The more notorious gangsters are Shakti Naidu-the Lajpat Nagar robbery kingpin; Ravi Gangwal and Vijay Khatik-the oldest of the lot-who manage their operations from jail. Gangwal was jailed in 2014 for the murder of two juveniles associated with the Ajay Chauhan gang. Chauhan retaliated by stabbing Gangwal's lieutenant Sachin, who was later knifed to death in August 2014 by two juveniles working for him.    Before Gangwal could take revenge, Chauhan was arrested in a murder case. However, in May this year, he was murdered in Tihar Jail. Sunday's killing was a fallout of this murder as Raju, the gangster who was shot dead, worked for Gangwal while Deepak Pandit, who led the attack, worked for Chauhan.    For police, the greater worry is that the gangs have no dearth of willing recruits. Teenage boys in these financially and educationally disadvantaged areas regard a gang's membership as a badge of honour. They also enjoy the power it gives them over shopkeepers and vendors.    "Juveniles make the best recruits as they are let off with light sentences and not included in the police database. They know the law is soft on them, and exploit this to the hilt for money and power," a senior inspector associated with the southern range said.    Truly Delhi's underbelly, this area has seen the profile of crime and criminals change over the years. From picking pockets, the gangs have moved on to killing and robbing. The gang leaders are trying their hand at property dealing and settling property disputes.    Small-time jewellers have popped up in the area to buy stolen jewellery from thieves at bargain prices. The latest to set up shop are gunrunners with ties to the Meerut weapon suppliers.  ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Tihar-Jail-turns-control-room-for-gang-lords/articleshow/48659866.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: Instead of Tihar jail being a symbol of crime deterrence, it is ironically becoming the control room from where gang lords oversee operations and expand their network. Police have found that the criminals treat the jail premises as a safe haven from rivals and have learnt to adroitly circumvent all preventive measure taken by the authorities to stymie them.    The jail lodges kingpins of gangs operating in Delhi, NCR and Haryana, and sources in the jail claim that they are running their outfits from inside the jail. They cite the examples of Shravan, Bablu Ghogha or Bawania and Dabodia gangs as being currently masterminded from within Tihar.    In the past two years, police have caught criminals making extortion calls or coordinating with gang members outside on many occasions. Gangsters Naveen Bali and Amit Shukla, the men behind the murders of journalist Sowmya Vishwanathan and IT professional Jigisha Ghosh, were among those detected using multiple numbers and making threat calls to realtors in Delhi and Mumbai.    Often, plans to eliminate or attack rivals outside are hatched in the jail, as was the case in Sunday's shooting of a man by gangsters in Greater Kailash on Sunday. But the gangs are a menace inside the jail too, as TOI had highlighted in a series of reports in June. Frequently, the scores are settled in the jail    Isolation from their rivals and the presence of criminals from other states assist the inmates in planning and executing operations in the city and other places. "The logistical and manpower support from gangs in neighbouring states helps Delhi's criminal groups," says a senior police officer familiar with the gangs' modus operandi. "Their interaction with the mixed population in Tihar facilitates awareness about weaponry and techniques. It's like a coaching centre for them."    With Tihar's infrastructure stretched to the limit-it lodges 14,000 criminals despite a capacity of just 5,200-it is difficult for the authorities to rein in the activities of the gangs. Jail officials have cracked down on the use of mobile phones inside Tihar, but more needs to be done. The police say that phone jammers and a closer watch on the activities of gang lords are urgently required if the menace is to be checked.  ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Trigger-happy-gangs-rising-in-the-east/articleshow/48659856.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||  NEW DELHI: Betting, gambling, illegal constructions and motor vehicle thefts are what gangs of east and northeast Delhi specialize in. And their attempts to exercise control over these illegal operations often lead to bloody gang wars.    Tackling crime in these areas poses a challenge to Delhi Police as gangsters can easily escape to neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. Unlike the criminals of south and southeast Delhi, gangsters here don't hesitate to shoot at cops. Last year, two policemen were killed while fighting gangsters running a betting racket in northeast Delhi.    Like the criminals of Haryana and outer Delhi, those from east and northeast Delhi are also trigger-happy, said police officers.    "While there are known gangsters like Hashim Baba and the slain Akil Mama, it's the splinter groups and offshoots which run the crime scene in east and northeast Delhi. Anwar Thakur, from whose house a huge cache of arms was seized last year, is another player in this area," said a senior officer.    Sources said Khurvesh, alias Pappu, is another major criminal. He is involved in more than 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, assault on police, extortion and robbery. Khurvesh operated with other gangsters like Dinesh Giri and Satparkesh, alias Satte and created terror among businessmen. Later, a dispute erupted between Khurvesh and Giri over their share of booty. They split and formed separate gangs. This unleashed a gang war in the area.    Akil Mama and Abdul Nasir gangs were at loggerheads as well. In November 2013, Nasir's gang gunned down Mama in front of about 100 people gathered at a funeral in Jaffrabad. The two gangs were at peace before Mama allegedly eliminated Nasir's close aide Atif after he abducted Akil's friend. Nasir retaliated by shooting Mateen in 2012. Akil's men then gunned down Tabrej, who was close to Nasir.    With Ghaziabad, Loni and other areas being at a stone's throw, this area has become a safe haven for interstate criminals. Vehicle thieves often hide in east and northeast Delhi in the day and strike at night. Within hours, they reach Soti Ganj and other areas near Meerut where stolen vehicles are dismantled.      ||NEW DELHI

He was picked up from a nondescript rented house occupied by Mohammad Rahdar from Ansari's neighbourhood at Bettiah's Jamadar Tola.    "We tracked and nailed him on the request of Bihar Police. Ansari was about to shift to Goa to expand his narcotics racket," Delhi Police DCP (special cell) Rajiv Ranjan told this correspondent over the phone on Monday, adding Rahdar was also wanted in connection with a case of murder in Bettiah.    West Champaran SP Vinay Kumar has rushed to Delhi to bring back the fugitive who carried a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head. Kumar, during his earlier stint as SP in neighbouring East Champaran district, had been instrumental in nabbing Indian Mujahideen (IM) chief Yasin Bhatkal in August 2013. His going to Delhi personally has triggered whispers of Ansari's possible links with the IM.    Son of tailor Momin Ansari, Samir suddenly gained notoriety with several cases of murder and extortion in 2009. Nabbed, he escaped from police custody in 2010. Taking refuge in Nepal, he established a web of terror and crime in West Champaran.    "Ansari admitted visiting Bettiah regularly to maintain his hegemony," DCP Ranjan said. His confession revives tales of terror calls to property owners, businessmen and even policemen at Bettiah. While watching a movie in a cinema hall in 2012, the then Bettiah SDPO Sharad Kumar received a call from Ansari in Nepal: 'My men are outside. Be prepared to die'. A posse of policemen rushed to escort the officer to safety. In December 2013, Ansari's cronies opened fire at Bettiah collectorate to grab a contract.    Remote-controlling his henchmen in the narcotics and FICN trade, he is suspected to have amassed a fortune in real estate. "He has acquired a large number of urban properties by intimidation," DCP Ranjan said.    ||BETTIAH
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:13 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

The woman's brothers reportedly broke the lock of the private ward under 'family ward' and took her with them. The woman's in-laws have accused hospital staff of carelessness. Police have lodged an FIR for "kidnapping in order to murder" against three men on Sunday night. They are investigating the whole incident including lapse of security at the mental hospital.     According to reports, the woman's in-laws admitted her to a mental hospital on August 13 and they requested hospital authorities to shift her to the general ward. However, their request was denied and hence, the in-laws moved the ACJM (NER) court. The court ordered the mental hospital's director on Saturday to shift the woman to the general ward. Despite court's order, the woman was kept in a private ward of 'family ward'.     The woman's husband is a wing commander in the Air Force.     An official of the hospital who did not wish to be identified said, "On Saturday night at around 11 pm, three men reached the hospital in a white car. They somehow managed to enter hospital premises and went to the family ward. They first asked hospital staff for keys of the family ward and when they refused to give, the men broke the lock and took the women with them in their car."     The woman's in-laws have accused hospital authorities of carelessness. "If hospital authorities had shifted her to the general ward, her brothers may not have been able to kidnap her. As it is mandatory for a family member to stay with the patient, we wanted her to shift to the general ward. At the time of incident, we had gone out to have dinner," said the woman's brother-in-law.     He added, "When we came back and learnt about her kidnapping but no hospital staff came at night to enquire about it. As the woman was missing from the hospital's premise, it was the responsibility of hospital authorities to lodge an FIR, which we had to later."     He said his sister-in-law was suffering from mental illness since 2007 and they had taken her to a few places for treatment. "After her condition deteriorated, we brought her to Bareilly mental hospital for treatment," he added.     On the basis of complaint filed by the woman's in-laws, police have lodged an FIR against her brothers under section 364 (for kidnapping in order to murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). "I spoke to woman's brothers over phone and they said that no family member had accompanied the woman in the hospital. The brothers claimed that they got emotional over this and took their sister to Mumbai for better treatment. However, we are investigating the matter," said Inspector Mohd Qasim, Baradari police station.     Asked why woman was not shifted to the general ward even after the order of ACJM (NER) court, junior director (health) Dr Subodh Sharma said, "When the director tried to shift the woman before court's order, the woman, who is educated, told the director that she is fine and is not suffering from mental illness. After court's order, the woman had to be shifted on Sunday but she was taken away on Saturday night." He added, "As the woman was admitted to a family ward, it is the duty of attendant and family member to look after the patient. If she had gone missing from general ward, then hospital authorities would have taken action."     On being asked about security lapse on the part of the hospital, Sharma said, "I will ask director of mental hospital to look into the matter and take appropriate action." Despite repeated attempts, director Dr Sunil Srivastava was unavailable for comment.     ||BAREILLY

Acting on a tip-off that an autorickshaw driver in Goregaon was possibly involved in some crime, "our officers hired his auto and engaged him in conversation to gauge his body language", said senior inspector Vinayak Vast.    The accused, who identified himself as Sanjay Shettiar, admitted that he along with his friend and brother had killed a driver while they were returning from a pilgrimage in Trimbakeshwar in Nashik in July 2011."They then robbed the driver and fled with his vehicle," said inspector Sanjeev Dhumal.    The accused also admitted to have killed a distant relative and moneylender from Santacruz. Sanjay said the deceased Pappu Dedia had given loans to him and his brother. As they could not repay it, they killed him. tnn  ||MUMBAI

Meerut had a murder rate of 6.5 for every lakh in population in 2014 as compared to 10.00 in Patna. Ranchi in Jharkhand was in third place with 5.4. Agra became the second city from western UP to find a place in the top five with a murder rate of 4.5. Data was collected from 53 cities in India, of which Kannur in Kerala had the lowest murder rate (0.1), followed by Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu (0.2).    In terms of the number of murders, Delhi was at the top of the table with 472 cases and 496 victims. However, the rate of murder in the national capital was much lower than Meerut, at 2.9. With 93 cases of murder and 98 victims in 2014, Meerut barely avoided the worst 10 list as it came in below Nagpur at number 11.    In terms of state statistics, data is available for seven cities in UP, of which Meerut has the highest rate of murder and the second highest number of cases. State capital Lucknow tops the list with most number of murders in UP with 107 instances and 109 victims. Lucknow (3.7) has the third highest murder rate in the state after Meerut and Agra.    According to DIG Ramit Sharma, there is nothing that makes Meerut a particularly troublesome city. "I have not had a detailed look at the figures so it would be wrong for me to comment. However, I can say that Meerut is like any other city in western UP. There is nothing that sets it apart from Hapur, Bulandshahr or Ghaziabad."    City-based psychologist Sona Kaushal said violent tendencies have become internalized among city residents as a result of conditioning. "There is a culture of violence in the city nowadays. This comes from conditioning. If children grow up in an atmosphere where violence is seen as a legitimate tool to settle disputes or if they grow up in a house riddled with instances of domestic violence, they tend to take it as a part of normalcy. If parents want their children to not become criminals, they need to start leading by example. This is a vicious cycle and parents need to break it."    Kaushal added that another reason for such a trend was the lack of deterrence. "If people see that rapists and murderers are getting off easy without any punishment, it clearly emboldens them. A higher conviction rate for criminals can prevent the rise of new criminals. If parents stop taking crime so casually and if the law is enforced, Meerut can become a safer city," added the psychologist.  ||MEERUT

The duo along with 22 others have been chargesheeted in the case of alleged rioting and attempt to murder police personnel in Velim church premises prior to assembly polls, on February 25, 2012.     The Margao JMFC court will hear the case on Monday at 10am.     While Gonsalves, the former parish priest of Velim, and presently in the US, is expected to arrive later this month, Dias confirmed to STOI that he received the summons around 7.20pm, from PI Gurudas Kadam.     Dias, the former parish priest of Assolna church, also told STOI that deputy chief minister Francis D'Souza had assured him that the government would intervene in the case when it comes up in the sessions court.     Parishioners of Velim, aggrieved with the case, had organized a candlelight vigil and a signature campaign on August 2.     A memorandum had also been submitted to chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, urging the government to drop the case as it would severely affect the future prospects of the youth (named as accused in the case) when they seek gainful employment abroad.     When contacted, Velim MLA Benjamin Silva reiterated that he had raised this issue during the recent monsoon assembly session, where he had pointed out that "the people had lost their trust in the government... The truth has not come out and people are annoyed with the government".     He added to TOI, "The court procedure will have to be followed since the charges have been framed against the accused; only then can the case be withdrawn. But the government has given an assurance that no harm would be caused to the accused in this case."     Apart from the two priests, the other accused are Louis Fernandes, Agnelo D'Silva, Adlete Mascarenhas, Max Colaco, Savio Pereira, Angelo Fernandes, Atorin Pereira, Alin Rebello, Mario Rebello, Tony Rebello, Adolfo Fernandes, Marcus Barros, Agnelo D'Souza, Nelson Caeiro, Nigel Caeiro, Savio Silva, Agnelo Silva, Angelo Afonso, Darwin D'Silva and Patrick D'Silva.     They have all been charged under Section 307 (attempt to murder), besides Sections 143, 144, 147, 148, 186, 323, 324, 326, 332, 333, 341, 342, 353 read with Section 149 of IPC for allegedly forming an unlawful assembly with deadly weapons such as stones and glass bottles, and for having assaulted and pelted stones on police personnel who were discharging their lawful duty.     CID police personnel, comprising of police sub-inspector (PSI) Kapil Nayak, head constable Krishnanand Rane and police constable Kuldip Dessai were allegedly confined within Velim church premises and had to be rescued.     They had visited the church to obtain intelligence inputs on whether the voters of Velim would exercise their franchise in the 2012 assembly elections or not. The rescuing squad comprising PSI Sandeep Kesarkar and other CRPF jawans were also injured in the mob attack.     ||MARGAO

It was the first time Steenkamp's parents have spoken out against the court's verdict.     Pistorius, 28, was found guilty last September of culpable homicide, the equivalent of manslaughter, after Judge Thokozile Masipa said state prosecutors had failed to prove the Paralympic gold medallist had shown "intent" to kill.     The state argued throughout the six-month trial that Pistorius had deliberately killed Steenkamp when he fired four rounds through a locked toilet door where she was hiding after a row. Pistorius says he believed an intruder was inside the toilet cubicle.     Prosecutors filed an appeal last week asking for the verdict to be changed to murder. They argue Pistorius must have known when he fired that the person behind the door could be killed, even if he did not know it was Steenkamp. The appeal hearing is due to start in November.     "What actually came out in court is not the truth," Barry Steenkamp told Australia's Channel Seven television in an interview aired on Sunday.     "He got angry, she went off to the toilet, locked herself inside, and then him pulling out the gun and shooting."     June Steenkamp adds: "Why didn't he just let her walk away?"     Pistorius, nicknamed the "Blade Runner" because of the carbon-fibre prosthetics he used during his career on the track, was due to be released from prison last Friday after serving 10 months of his five-year sentence.     Justice minister Michael Masutha blocked his release because he said the decision was made without legal basis, an intervention the Pistorius family said left them "shocked and disappointed".     The decision has been returned to the parole board for reconsideration, which could take up to four months.     Steenkamp's parents have said previously they were unhappy with the court's sentencing but this is the first time they have publicly questioned the verdict.     If convicted of murder, Pistorius will likely be given a custodial sentence of at least 15 years.||JOHANNESBURG
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Criminal-nabbed-with-pistol/articleshow/48653527.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||PUNE: The Pune crime branch has recently arrested a criminal on the police records and recovered a country made pistol and two cartridges from his possession.     The police have identified the suspect as Vivek alias Sonya Sopan Kalbhor (22) a resident of Anubai Kalbhor Chawl, Akurdi. The anti-extortion cell of the Pune crime branch led by inspector Anil Patil has made the arrest.     Patil said that recently he and his team were patrolling in the jurisdiction of the Khadki police station. Police constable Sachin Ahivale got the tip-off that a criminal on the police records Kalbhor possessed a pistol and he was at the Gandhiangar slums in Bopodi. "We rushed to Bopodi and laid a trap near the Gandhinagar slums," Patil said.     Patil said that the police team comprised assistant inspector Vitthal Shelar, police constables Nilesh Desai, Prashant Pawar, Ganesh Mali, Siddharth Lokhande, Raju Pawar, Baban Borhade and Chandrakant Sawant nabbed Kalbhor from the Gandhinagar slums. "We found a country made pistol and two cartridges with him," Patil said.     Patil said that the suspect Kalbhor is the criminal on the records of the Nigdi police station. He has five cases registered against him including murder, attempt to murder, body offenses and unlawful assembly. "We are investigating from where Kalbhor had procured the weapon," Patil said.||PUNE

Slain RTI activist Amit Jethava's murder accused Shiva Solanki, had contested the municipal polls in 2013 as a BJP candidate from jail. He had emerged victorious from jail. Shiva Solanki, a nephew of former BJP MP from Junagadh Dinu Solanki, who is also accused in Jethava murder case, had filed his nomination from ward number nine in Kodinar municipality and campaigned while being lodged in jail.     BJP had made a clean sweep of Kodinar municipality by winning all the 27 seats. This was BJP's third consecutive win in the municipal polls.     Jethava was shot dead near Gujarat high court (HC) in July 2010. Ahmedabad Crime Branch had arrested six persons in the case, including Shiva and sharp shooter Sailesh Pandya, who had allegedly fired at Jethava. Jethava had filed several petitions in the HC against the forest department along with public interest litigations (PIL) on illegal mining in Gir forests of Junagadh district, which is considered the last abode of Asiatic lions in the world.     Jethava's father Bikha Jethava approached the HC stating that the police had not conducted any investigation in the alleged involvement of Solanki in the murder. In September 2012, the HC had ordered CBI probe in the case.     Shiva was the president of Kodinar municipality before he was arrested. A special CBI court granted bail to Shiva Solanki last year. The CBI court had granted bail to Solanki at furnishing bail bond of Rs 5 lakh, along with other routine conditions imposed on him. He was arrested in 2010 by the city crime branch, which filed a chargesheet against him and five others.||RAJKOT
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movie-reviews/Natoker-Moto/articleshow/48652959.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||Kheya's body is recovered from the Hooghly, leading to a series of protests by theatre lovers in Kolkata. Did the actress willingly jump off the launch while acting the part of a blind mother, was it murder or just another accident? Truth must be told. Calcutta Port Police begins a probe that throws light on the actress and her life on stage.She died young. And sank without a trace from public memory. If not for Natoker Moto Keya Chakraborty may have been carried away by a buoyant tide to anonymity. This was a distinct possibility. But like a mystery that she was in life, the lioness on stage, who met with a tragic ending, continues to haunt, even in death. Suddenly, she is everywhere. Two of this week's plays â€” Sher Afgaaner Tiner Talowar and Nandikar's Bhalomanush, based on Brecht's The Good Woman of Setzuan, where a young Sohini Sengupta led from the front â€” mentioned Keya in passing, during and before the performances. And then, there's a Friday throwback to the past.Those not in the know, in March 1977 Keya, 34, a popular theatre actress, lost her life reportedly by drowning near Sankrail during the shoot of Swadesh Sarkar's Jeevan Jey Rokom. The circumstances were mysterious and the versions of eyewitnesses, bystanders and acquaintances varied. While that was the end of a young dream, it is the starting point of Debesh Chattopadhyay's film. And like in real life, Calcutta Port Police takes charge soon after. Through interactions with characters surrounding Kheya (Paoli), Bhobodulal Roy (Rajatava Dutta) pieces together events and in the process, uncovers facts piecemeal. What is unveiled is the journey of a lone woman and her fight for love. Kheya says her only love is theatre, though she falls for Prosad ( Saswata Chatterjee ), her college senior, early in life. Their meeting scene at the football ground coupled with an ebullient song, Pasha pashi hete jete jete, is one of the best moments in the film.Natoker Moto also touches upon Kheya's bonding with Amitesh (Bratya Basu), her mentor in the theatre group Notokar, Monoranjan (Sujan Mukherjee), her professor, and throws up a few pertinent questions on love and relationships. But beyond the physical manifestations of love â€” she cooks and cleans for Prosad, leaves her job when Amitesh suggests theatre needs full-time involvement and takes money unhesitatingly from Monoranjan for her mother's treatment â€” there is the call of the unrequited... Knowing well that theatre would take from her more than it would ever give, Kheya gives everything to it. Paoli internalizes Kheya and surrenders completely to what the role demands. Even in the in-film plays like Antigone, Noti Binodini, Proposal, she shines â€” like a star would from a distant horizon and another era. She shows her mettle even while singing Ami jokhon meye thaki, a fresh new composition by Debajyoti Mishra for Bhalomanush and leaves us wondering if Kheya and Keya are indeed one.The scene based on Keya's own Mrs RP Sengupta, where tears wash away the letters of a poem the actress had started translating, signifies her longing to stay alone and fight a battle, her own. Debesh has based much of his film on the book he once edited: Keya, and other reference points available since the late '70s. But the film doesn't go beyond what's already there in the public domain â€” though it does bring back good old memories, with a bit of spite. It's strange when Prosad faces an unassuming Bhobodulal's queries right after her death. His answers drip with arrogance and sarcasm, and was he really crying just before the cremation?Misplaced human emotions and lack of subtlety take a toll on the film in parts. But then, the director has mentioned that the film is a work of fiction and therefore taken creative liberties, though resemblances with real-life characters are too close to ignore. In the scenes where life transforms into the stage, the first-time director, who has a huge body of work in theatre, manages to freeze-frame important aspects of Kheya's life and highlight her pathos. Though many actors in bit roles are in character â€” Sujan particularly looks good â€” a few interactions are glaringly 'natoker moto'. Like the way, Kheya's mother (Roopa Ganguly) walks out on her after a heated exchange with her suspecting husband one night.Indranil Mukherjee's camera effortlessly captures everything from the close-up of a face contorted with pain to the long shot of Kheya's mortal remains wrapped in a Murshidabadi silk floating downstream as Moushumi Bhowmik's Ami shunechhi sedin tumi plays in the backdrop. Then, there are important questions that have plagued group theatre time and again, as Amitesh puts it, "Dol-er jonyo theatre na, theatre-er jonyo dol". The depiction of '70s Kolkata is authentic, not the portrayal of every character who lived and breathed during that era. In the end, we come back to where it all began â€” did Kheya jump off willingly, was it someone else's doing or was it a stroke of tragedy? We'll never know. The truth is buried in her watery grave.||
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-to-grant-rare-prisoner-amnesties-for-war-anniversary/articleshow/48652730.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||BEIJING: China plans to grant prisoner amnesties to mark this year's commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two, only the eighth time this has happened since the Communists took power in 1949, state news agency Xinhua said on Monday.     Four categories of prisoners - mostly elderly - who do not pose a threat to society will be given a special amnesty, Xinhua quoted Li Shishi, head of the Chinese parliament's standing committee, as saying.     That will include prisoners who fought in the war against the Japanese, or who fought in wars post 1949 to "protect the country's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity", or who are older than 75, Xinhua said.     It did not say how many people would be set free as a result of this amnesty, and Li said that exceptions will apply to people convicted of serious crimes like murder, rape, bribery or terror offences.     There have only been seven previous instances of these special amnesties since the Communist take over, Xinhua said.     The move is in line with international practice and will help increase popular confidence in the party's efforts to boost the rule of law, it added.     More than 10,000 troops - mostly Chinese but with contingents from Russia, Mongolia and a few other countries - will march through central Beijing on Sept. 3 in a military parade that will be the highlight of events marking the war's end.||BEIJING

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:19 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Pathan (55) and his 30-year-old son Asif were shot dead just outside their house in Subhashnagar at around 10.30pm on Saturday by four persons. The accused were identified as Akbar Khan Pathan, Abbas Anvar Kachara and Sajid alias Mohsin alias Saheel Hussein Kachra.     Police said that the Pathans and Abbas were at loggerheads since many years over the latter's liquor den operating in a building in Azad Chowk where the Pathan family has seven shops. Sources said that Abbas' illegal business was hit hard since last few months as the Pathan family had installed CCTV cameras.     On Saturday night, Abbas and his three accomplices were waiting outside Pathan's house. As soon as he arrived, Sajid fired at him and the bullet pierced his chest. Pathan ran towards his house but Sajid followed him and opened two more rounds at him. Hearing the firing shots, Pathan's three sons Akbar, Asif and Arbas rushed out. While Asif tried to save his father, Akbar and Arbas charged towards Abbas Anvar. Sajid then fired two rounds at Asif.     Amid the chaos, Abbas stabbed Akbar but the latter and his brother Arbas snatched his knife and stabbed Abbas too. However, Sajid and two others managed to escape from the spot.     Pathan and Asif were rushed to a private hospital where they were declared brought dead. Akbar too was taken to another private hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.     One of the accused, Abbas was rushed to a private hospital and his condition is out of danger. Main accused Sajid managed to escape from the spot. After the incident, senior police officials rushed to the spot and launched a probe. Abbas lives in Nehrunagar and Sajid lives in Dhruvnagar in the city.     Iliyas Khan was BJP leader and his son Akbar owns advertising agency and an English newspaper.     Police has been deployed in the hospital where the accused Abbas is recuperating. They will arrest him after doctor's opinion.     "Abbas was angry with our family ever since we purchased shops in the building where he was selling liquor under the garb of running a seasonal store. After we installed CCTV cameras, police raided his shops and seized liquor. This led to further animosity and Abbas had been seeking revenge since then," Pathan's son Akbar told police in the complaint.     "We have seized a knife, revolver, a pistol and a bike from the crime scene," RR Solanki, investigating officer of Gandhigram police station, said.     Meanwhile, local BJP leaders also visited Pathan's family and offered condolences.||RAJKOT

Pistorius says he believed an intruder was inside the toilet cubicle.Prosecutors filed an appeal last week asking for the verdict to be changed to murder. They argue Pistorius must have known when he fired that the person behind the door could be killed, even if he did not know it was Steenkamp. The appeal hearing is due to start in November."What actually came out in court is not the truth," Barry Steenkamp told Australia's Channel Seven television in an interview aired on Sunday."He got angry, she went off to the toilet, locked herself inside, and then him pulling out the gun and shooting."June Steenkamp adds: "Why didn't he just let her walk away?"Pistorius, nicknamed the "Blade Runner" because of the carbon-fibre prosthetics he used during his career on the track, was due to be released from prison last Friday after serving 10 months of his five-year sentence.Justice Minister Michael Masutha blocked his release because he said the decision was made without legal basis, an intervention the Pistorius family said left them "shocked and disappointed".The decision has been returned to the parole board for reconsideration, which could take up to four months.Steenkamp's parents have said previously they were unhappy with the court's sentencing but this is the first time they have publicly questioned the verdict.If convicted of murder, Pistorius will likely be given a custodial sentence of at least 15 years.||JOHANNESBURG

The inspiration can be traced back to Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None. Following the release of this book, right from the 1940s, there have been films that have dealt with this theme, which include Death Of The Night, Breakheart Pass and Murder On The Orient Express in Hollywood.     In India, Gumnaam started this trend, which has continued ever since, with the latest example being Table No. 21. This has even found favour on the small screen in the west with TV series like Lost and Survivor.    KM Chaitanya's Aatagara also deals with a similar theme. It features 10 people who go to an island and have to live in a house without any contact with the outside world. The idea for this film arose from the thought of what would happen if a reality show went wrong. The makers say that this psychological thriller, with shades of a vigilante film, sees an unknown force guiding the 10 protagonists to be a part of this show and follows what happens when all hell breaks loose during that show.

A group of kids play there, enclosed by brightly-painted walls, even as heavily-armed hawk-eyed security personnel man the jail's fence like a fortress. Too unlikely, but in the world of criminals is this space where innocence lives in the form of some 30 kids; and dolls, cradles and games replace arms, drugs and gang wars.    The Tihar campus is home to these kids-all under the age of six-along with their mothers who are either undertrials or have been sentenced for crimes like murders or dowry deaths. There are 618 women inmates in Tihar, including 28 mothers-all undertrials.    Tara, an undertrial charged with murder, is an inmate of Jail Number 6, meant for women, for the past four years. Lodged in jail when her baby was just a few months old, Tara hasn't known the world outside ever since. The kid is four now, and the jail the child's only home. While Tara is engrossed in her daily chores between 9am and 5pm with other inmates, her kid, in the meantime, is taught everything at the jail's creche that the children outside the jail learn.    The day for these kids at the creche begins with breakfast which includes cereals, milk and eggs. Thereafter, the children above the age of three are taken to the nursery class, while the younger lot to the other section.    READ ALSO: Letter on plight of women prisoners to be turned a PIL    The NGO India Vision helps Tihar run it. The volunteers of the NGO and a few women inmates take classes. The kids here have a uniform, and officials say it is to give them a sense of equality with those who study in the schools outside.    They are good at everything, say officials, as the kids spell the name of fruits in chorus, with some engaged in theme-based drawing and painting.    "The women's jail superintendent, Anju Mangla, closely supervises the creche so that there is no negligence on anyone's part," said DIG, prisons, Mukesh Prasad.    READ ALSO: Take steps to release 152 Tihar undertrials, orders Delhi high court    "These children are respected here. Their very presence gives us a sense of harmony. There is no aggression on the part of the inmates towards them and they are well protected," a senior official said. These children were either born in jail or were too young when their mothers were arrested. They do not have any relative or father, an official said.    Sakeena, charged with murder, has been serving time since last year. A mother of three-year-old, she was concerned about her child's future. Now, she feels the creche is doing a good job. Every evening she collects her kid from there and relishes knowing that the child has learnt something new.    The mothers here live with a painful truth though. The kids will have to leave the jail after the age of six and mothers dread the day and the separation.    READ ALSO: Govt must answer for plight of undertrials    "We want that these kids should not be left behind others of their age when they leave the jail. Our motive is to rehabilitate them and provide them with a better condition," said Prasad.    But for inmates like Aarti, hope is the only resort. An undertrial who has a three-year-old kid, she was jailed three years ago. All that she hopes is to be released before her daughter turns six.||NEW DELHI

The victim, identified as Meeru Tudu (60), was killed at her home in a tea garden belonging to one Ramona Marak around 8 pm on Saturday.    The accused, Nayan Baski (28) from the same village, was arrested on Saturday night and a case under Section 302 of the IPC was registered against him, sources said.    The preliminary probe revealed that the accused blamed the victim for his wife's "continuous ill health" and went to the woman's house on Saturday to ask her to release his wife from any "spell and cure her".    "What followed was a heated argument and according to the accused, in a fit of rage, he grabbed a log that was near him and hit the woman on her head and she died instantly," said the in-charge of Byrnihat police outpost, D Nongrum.    The accused was produced before the district special judge on Sunday and remanded in judicial custody. Nongrum said police were awaiting the post-mortem report to proceed further with the case.    Nongrum added that since the accused had confessed to his crime, it was an "open and shut case", even as he expressed regret that such incidents continued to occur despite the administration trying to educate people to let go of such superstitions and beliefs.  ||SHILLONG

They found that the engineer had sold the phone to the Maduravoyal shop owner.The Maduravoyal shop owner told police he had taken a photograph of Depnath because he was behaving shiftily. Investigators used the picture to catch the killer and discovered that he stayed in the same apartment complex as the doctor.S Sathya, 32, a first-year MS (obstetrics and gynaecology) student at Kilpauk Medical College, shared her flat with a senior from the college. The mother of two was from Perambalur and had come to the city two months ago.Police said Depnath had completed his BTech in May and was looking for a job. He stayed in a flat on the first floor of the apartment with his brother, a doctor at a multispecialty hospital on Greams Road."Sathya had fallen asleep after returning home on Thursday after a night shift," an investigating officer said. "Harintham admitted that he stealthily entered the house by unlatching the door from outside. As he picked up the cellphone, the doctor awoke and raised an alarm."Depnath panicked and assaulted Sathya, then used a pillow to muffle her cries for help."When she started to suffocate and swooned, he took a knife from her kitchen and stabbed her repeatedly in the neck," the officer said. "He left the knife in her neck, went home and washed his bloodstained shirt.""He then sold the cellphone to a mobile phone dealer in Maduravoyal," he said. "A customer named Gopal purchased the phone and activated it on Sunday. We questioned the shop owner and he gave us the picture of Depnath."Depnath told police he kept tabs on Sathya's schedule and knew she would be sleeping after a night shift. "He decided to commit the crime before Sathya's flatmate Sangeetha returned home in the afternoon," the officer said.||CHENNAI

Nallamarudu was rearrested on August 22.     Many in Madurai's legal circles say the re-arrest after the "premature release" may be termed as one of the rarest incidents in legal parlance. Some said, since the re-arrest was made after six years, it was subject to judicial review, though many felt there's nothing wrong in effecting the re-arrest with delay. Meanwhile, it is learnt that Marudu is getting ready to challenge the government order cancelling his release.     Marudu was released on condition that he would refrain from committing any offence in the next three years. However, he allegedly committed a murder in Madurai and made an attempt to murder in Tuticorin within one year of his release. In both cases, he had been released on bail.     In 2009 (during DMK government's tenure), an auto driver was found dead on the Ring Road. The police filed a case of accident. After AIADMK came to power in 2011, police reinvestigated the incident and found it was a murder case and Marudu was the prime accused. However, Marudu evaded arrest till August 2012.     In another incident, the Tuticorin police registered an attempt to murder case against Marudu after he allegedly tried to kill an AIADMK supporter during the election campaign in Kulasekarapattinam in Tuticorin district in 2009.     Advocate Veera Kathiravan, who had appeared for Marudu in obtaining bail in the attempt to murder case, said that the re-arrest was politically motivated. "Legally, it is not correct since the arrest has been effected after a gap of six years," he said. Contradicting that, senior counsel M Ajmalkhan said nothing was wrong in the government's delayed action.     "There was a delay in process of his re-arrest because the government took action as soon as the governor passed the order cancelling his release," said special government pleader M Govindan.     IPS officer Asra Garg, who cracked the murder case, said, "When I was in Madurai, the mother of the deceased auto driver approached me and said her son was killed, but the case had been closed as road accident. We reinvestigated the case and found it to be murder."     It was also reported that then inspector took a bribe of Rs 2 lakh to help Marudu in this murder case.     ||MADURAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Sheena-docu-Michail-add-to-mystery/articleshow/48701752.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||GUWAHATI: The persistent silence of Michail, Sheena's younger brother, on the identity of their biological father and the manner in which his sister's birth certificate was registered have raised a number of unanswered questions.    Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target.

Two days after his mother Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Mikhail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed what he gave the police was enough to prove Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora, who are actually Indrani's parents, as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. However, many questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter. In many cases in India involving single mothers, grandparents are known to put in their names as father and mother.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:24 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Turf-war-fought-with-guns-and-gore/articleshow/48646551.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The area between Sangam Vihar and Neb Sarai has always been a hotspot for criminals. The resettlement colonies in southeast Delhi have been home to two major gangs â€” led by Ravi Gangwal and the murdered Ajay Chauhan â€” who were in a turf war over the lucrative water and cable business. Police sources say that Sunday's shootout might have ended their fight for supremacy.     Chauhan's gang, led by the mastermind of Sunday's shootout Deepak Pandit, had earlier attempted to kill Raju Rao, a property dealer managing Gangwal's gang since his arrest in 2014. Rao had been shot in the abdomen, but managed to escape.     Rao's wife Rekha claims that after the attack he had tried to settle the dispute with Pandit for Rs 50 lakh, but he kept demanding more money. Rao then shifted to an apartment in Lajpat Nagar to escape from Pandit's men and had reportedly even complained to the police about the threat to his life.     Police said that Pandit's gang was trailing Rao for the past 20 days. Gangwal was aware of this and had ordered his men to conduct a recee in the areas before Rao visited them.     Sangam Vihar was once a playing field of at least six organized gangs, each with 20-30 men including Gangwal, Chauhan and Khatik. Cops said that Gangwal moved to real estate, including settling property disputes, and also gained control over the water tankers. He soon developed a rivalry with Chauhan operating a similar syndicate around Sainik Farms and Neb Sarai.     "Initially the fights were limited to scuffles between gang members. But gradually they started getting weapons from Meerut ordered over the phone," said a police officer.     Gangwal was jailed in 2014 for the murder of two juveniles associated with Chauhan's gang. In retaliation, Chauhan had stabbed Gangwal's right hand man Sachin who led the gang in his absence. Sachin was later knifed to death in August 2014 by two juveniles employed by Chauhan. Sources said that before Gangwal could take revenge, Chauhan was arrested in a murder case.     With Chauhan out of the way, Gangwal tried to control an illegal scrap dealing business and gave orders to his gang members over the phone. Earlier this year, he appointed Raju Rao to look after the gang's finances. He had even orchestrated the murder of one of Chauhan's associates running the scrap business. In may this year, Chauhan was stabbed to death inside Tihar Jail by Gangwal's men.     Chauhan's gang remained headless for sometime until Deepak Pandit took over. "He vowed to avenge Chauhan's death and kill Gangwal's men to establish supremacy over the area," said a police officer.||NEW DELHI

Five of them, including the including the kingpin, Deepak Pandit, have been nabbed and four pistols along with a large cache of ammunition recovered from them.The killing took place at the BRT-Sadiq Nagar crossing around 3.15am. The victim, Raju Rao, 32, and five of his associates were heading to the Kalkaji temple on three bikes after collecting a payment of Rs 6 lakh from a property consultant in Devli, police said.Rao, who had three attempt-to-murder cases against him, had halted at the crossing as two of his men had been stopped at a barricade. His associate Atul told cops that while Rao was waiting, a white Scorpio came from the Lajpat Nagar side and rammed the bike. As Rao fell, four men stepped out and fired 10-15 rounds at him from point blank range."All of them were wearing masks and waved their guns at us when we tried to intervene. They wanted to ensure that Raju was dead before they left the spot," said Atul.The SUV then fled towards Archana Complex. Sandeep Ghai, the Greater Kailash SHO who was on patrol duty, heard the gunshots and drove towards the spot. He saw the SUV speed away and quickly informed the police control room. A police van began chasing the SUV and asked its driver to stop. But he took a right turn from the Archana complex crossing and sped down the road with the police team in pursuit.Police officials said the driver of the SUV had probably planned to turn towards Chirag Dilli, but hit a dead end. The driver lost control and crashed through a wall and gate leading to a drain. As the Scoprio came to a stop, the men got out and started fleeing in different directions. The police team chased another gangster, Shankar, and managed to pin him down while the others escaped despite being injured in the crash."A team led by ACP Lajpat Nagar Deepak Yadav and inspector ATO Anil Malik had reached the scene by then and launched a search operation to nab the others. Two of them, Shan Mohammad and Bindu, were found hiding in the GK Block C park," said Mandeep Singh Randhawa, DCP southeast.Joint commissioner Depender Pathak said another of the killers was identified as Kapil Panwar. Search continues for one of the associates who remains at large.Deepak Pandit, the kingpin, was held by a security guard after the policemen alerted local RWAs and guards about them. Police said the men had decided to flee on foot and meet up near Kalkaji. Kapil managed to board an auto-rickshaw and head towards Kalkaji but was apprehended at a barricade when a police team stopped the vehicle for a check.Meanwhile, Rao was taken to the Max hospital by his associates where he was declared dead on arrival. The body was sent for an autopsy.Deepak Pandit has admitted that he planned the operation to eliminate Rao who headed a rival gang earlier led by jailed gangster Ravi Gangwal. Rao, it was suspected, had killed Pandit's associate Chhotu at Tihar Jail earlier this year. Sources say efforts were being made to nab a few others who had planned the operation.||NEW DELHI

Action under the Bombay Police Act against such joints already has already been initiated by Pachpaoli police stations on Saturday when two pool parlours were raided.  Raids were conducted on the illegal pool-cum-hookah parlour of Pawan Moriyani at Kamal Chowk by Pachpaoli police. Simultaneously, a raid was also conducted on the illegal pool parlour of Shankar Kamble located opposite to the gate of police station at Pachpaoli.  It is learnt that police complaint was lodged last week after a man was assaulted at pool-cum-hookah parlour near Kamal Chowk. Police sources also said that some close aides of a gangster, now in jail, often frequent the same pool where they are used as bouncers.  The pool, whose owner is close to a police officer, had become a hub of criminals but no action was being initiated until now.  Such joints were earlier asked to stop functioning following a public outcry in the backdrop of kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Kush Katariya in 2011. Though litigations had forced police to soften it's stance, such parlours continue to be opposed by activists.  City police chief SP Yadav has earlier told TOI that all hookah parlours are illegal and they are trying to playing hide-and-seek with the police. An RTI Act query showed that only two pool parlours (Underworld near Law College Square and Perfect) have the license to function.||

As many as 102 people were shot to death in 2014. Out of them, 80 were killed with unlicensed guns. These figures released by the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) raise a concern over the manufacturing and smuggling of weapons in the state.    Though Rajasthan is way behind other states like UP and Bihar in terms of use of illegal firearms in murders, what is worrying is the fact that the state is reporting increasing cases of illegal arms smuggling and manufacturing.    "Criminals from Haryana come to Mewat to buy weapons and then send them to various places. Guns are easily available and police are aware of the places where they are manufactured, but they have turned a blind eye to it," said a source.    Illegal arms are made in almost 50 villages in Bharatpur and Alwar. These villages include Bilakh, Daula Ka Baas, Jurhari, Sesan, Sikari, Gopalgarh, Papda, Jatur, Alla, Andwari, Katholi, Ladmaka, Pathrali, Satwari and Gaunsia in Bharatpur; and Palpur, Kharkhadi, Gvalanda, Nyana, Saidampur, Sirthali and Bhansdawat in Alwar, added the source.    Besides this, arms are supplied to dacoit gangs in Dholpur too. In some villages of Haryana like Firojpur, Jhirka, Nagal, Punhana and Gaodi, illegal guns are made.    "These guns are then sold in bulk to the traders who distribute them across the country," a senior police officer said.    "In Mewat, members of Meo, Sikligar and Harijan communities are known to be involved in gun manufacturing. It takes a person a day to make a gun. The work is executed in the villages in the hilly areas," said the officer. For people of the Sikligar community, weapon-making is the ancestral business. "Earlier, they used to make guns for kings' armies," he said.    As per the NCRB figures, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are way ahead of other states when it comes to the use of firearms in violence. As many as 1,331 people were killed using illegal firearms in UP and 787 in Bihar. Other states where the use of illegal fire arms in murders is more than Rajasthan are Haryana (178), Punjab (111), Odisha (105) and Madhya Pradesh (116).  ||JAIPUR

Deepika had been in a critical condition. Doctors at the Max Hospital said her condition had improved slightly on Friday, but it again deteriorated on Saturday. She finally succumbed to the bullet injuries at 12pm on Sunday.    "The bullet was still stuck in her head and could not be taken out. She died due to the injuries in her brain," Dr Arun Saroha, a neurosurgeon who was treating the victim, said.    The victim was shot when she was waiting for her school bus at Bilaspur Chowk on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at 7.30am on Thursday. Passersby had rushed her to Rockland Hospital in Manesar, from where she was taken to Max Hospital.    The accused was reportedly stalking the victim and killed her when she told her family about it.    Manjit told cops he had procured the weapon from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh. "The accused is now booked under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC instead of Section 307 (attempt to murder). He is currently on police remand and will be produced in the court on Monday," a police officer said.  ||GURGAON

The data released by National crime records bureau (NCRB) showed that 35,139 people were murdered last year nationwide.  Among the causes, personal enmity led as cause behind 2912 killings. It was followed by property dispute that was behind 2771 murders. It is one issue often ignored by police as a civil matter. Maharashtra led in number of murders of children below six-years-old with a total of 111 out of 518 cases in the country. Most murders related to illicit relationship (223) also took place in Maharashtra. The state with 2782 murders was third after Uttar Pradesh (5333) and Bihar (3593).  In the country, illicit relationships or suspicion of it led to 1196 murders in 2014. Complications related to love affairs also led to the murder of 1307 persons with maximum of 300 being in Uttar Pradesh followed by 239 in Tamil Nadu. Uttar Pradesh also topped in murder of rape victims with 54 such cases followed by 21 in Maharashtra. In both UP and Maharashtra, three victims of gang rape were killed while 11 such cases took place in the country. In capital Delhi, three victims of rapes were also murdered.  Among other motives, desire of personal gain of various types led to the murders of 1702 persons while dowry claimed 1280 lives. Disturbing trends too have come to fore like witchcraft and human sacrifices leading to murders. Suspicion of witchcraft led to 156 murders while another 16 were killed as human sacrifices.  DCP, crime, Deepali Masirkar said different regions and states had different reasons for murders depending upon their geographical, demographical, cultural and economic conditions. "The anti-social elements are more inclined to white collar crimes rather than using sheer muscle powers. They would rather encroach and extort rather than resort to goondaism for gains," she said.  DCP Masirkar said the monetary stakes are quite high for property or land nowadays that naturally would attract the attention of the criminals which may also lead to clashes. "Establishing domination through capturing or encroaching upon properties leads to gang war and murders," she said.||NAGPUR

She was murdered by the same man who was arrested for killing another 90-year-old who lived alone in Lalbagh. The assailant could have been identified much earlier had city police acted on the case promptly.    In her 90s, Ramrati Devi stayed at Newal Kishore road along with sons and daughter-in-law who reside in separate portions of the same building. On July 6, Ramrati was attacked and her cash and the jewellery she was wearing were robbed. Three days later a nonagenarian man Anand Kishore Raina was murdered at Lalbagh located Bhopal house in Hazratganj and the motive this time too was robbery.    Police nabbed three persons for Raina's murder within a week of the incident. The trio arrested included Rinku Awasthi, Naushad and Ghufran. During investigations cops came to know that the act was committed by four persons.    The maid who used to work for Raina was questioned later. She gave the name of Raju Naai, a history-sheeter from Sitapur district to city police as the fourth accomplice in the Raina murder case. "The maid was intimate with Raju," SSP Rajesh Pandey told the press. Raju was nabbed and grilled rigorously. Raju told police he had committed both the murder-robbery incidents of Hazratganj. "Rinku and Raju had teamed up and committed both the acts of crime. Rinku had feigned ignorance about Ramrati's murder though he was equally responsible for it," added Pandey.    "Since he was not grilled properly then, we were not aware of Rinku's involvement in both incidents," said another police officer.

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:29 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Ironically, the arrested salesman, Siddharth, had earlier protested with the locals demanding justice for the woman. He was also found involved in the rape of a minor girl. A resident of Bhagya Vihar, Siddharth worked at a shop in Rohini and the juvenile used to accompany him.    "A team led by inspector KP Malik and ASI Anil Kumar got information that the duo was seen drunk and high on drugs roaming in the locality late in the evening. A background check revealed that Siddharth had been arrested for raping a minor girl in January and was out on bail," said DCP (outer) Vikramjeet Singh.    Police said the accused started following the woman after seeing her walking alone. When she passed through a dark stretch they dragged her to a vacant plot. Siddharth held her in the crook of his elbow due to which she choked to death. They both then sexually assaulted and dumped the body in a vacant plot in Bhagya Vihar. They then fled with her clothes, cash and her SIM card. Her mobile phone was found in another plot.    The woman, who worked with an NGO in Rajouri Garden, used to go to her office at 8am and return around 8.30pm. When she didn't return home, her parents thought she had gone to her sister's house and didn't check. The next day a neighbour knocked on their door and gave a few documents belonging to her which he had found lying on the street.    Her father immediately called their elder daughter and she denied that the woman had come to her house. They then started a manhunt and found her body some 200 meters away from their house.    "The juvenile and the accused both had blocked the Mundka-Karala Road along with the locals protesting against the woman's murder demanding justice," a senior police officer said.  ||NEW DELHI

A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath asked Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to take necessary steps for their immediate release.    "The plight of the undertrials who have been languishing in prison without trial for a very long period has been taken note of by the Supreme Court as well as this court on several occasions and directions have been issued from time to time," the court said.    The court observed "that in spite of court orders, and periodic visits by officials and panel advocates of DSLSA, interaction with the inmates and Legal Services Clinics being organized in the jail complex...many of the undertrial prisoners are in jail for more than six months even though charges are not for serious offences".The court's observation came after it was informed by the superintendent of Tihar's jail 6 that there are 105 women undertrials, facing charges other than murder, rape, culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sections of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).    It was also informed that 47 women undertrials, in cases of multiple offences, have completed half of the period of their sentence in a lesser offence. The Tihar administration also informed the court that as per the statistics of December 31, 2014, about 43% of women prisoners are illiterate and most of them are from the low-income strata of society.  ||NEW DELHI

The girl, employed as domestic help by a married couple, had burn injuries on her body and also complained of back pain after being kicked by the wife for not doing her chores properly, said the cops.     The crime branch sleuths, along with the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) team had rescued the girl on Saturday But surprisingly, the accused couple has not been arrested yet by the Nerul police.     DCP (crime) Suresh Mengade said, "The victim appears frail and sick with burn marks on her body after being ill-treated by the accused couple who had brought her from Dehradun and employed her as a domestic help for the past four months at their Nerul flat."     The accused couple, Satyarthi Bhardwaj (38) and Jyoti Bhardwaj (30), have been booked under the relevant sections of the IPC, Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 and Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986. added DCP Mengade.     Senior police inspector Sangita Alphanso said the police team focused on her medical treatment first. Later, she was housed at the juvenile welfare home in Bhiwandi. "We will definitely arrest the couple, probably on Monday, as we have registered an FIR against them," she said.     Inspector Pushpalata Dighe, in-charge AHTU, said, "When the police team reached the Nerul flat, we were armed with video cameras. We have recorded the girl's statement where she claimed that the accused woman had been torturing her. She was given stale food to eat and not even provided with toothpaste and bathing soap and was dressed in rags."         ||NAVI MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sundays-shootout-in-GK-I-was-fight-for-supremacy-in-southeast-Delhi/articleshow/48645383.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:35 IST 2015||  NEW DELHI: The area between Sangam Vihar and Neb Sarai has always been a hotspot for criminals. The resettlement colonies in southeast Delhi have been home to two major gangs - led by Ravi Gangwal and the murdered Ajay Chauhan - which are in a turf war over the lucrative water and cable business. Police sources say that Sunday's shootout might have ended their fight for supremacy.    Chauhan's gang, led by the mastermind of Sunday's shootout Deepak Pandit, had earlier attempted to kill Raju Rao, a property dealer managing Gangwal's gang since his arrest in 2014. Rao had been shot in the abdomen, but managed to escape.    Rao's wife Rekha claims that after the attack he had tried to settle the dispute with Pandit for Rs 50 lakh, but he kept demanding more money. Rao then shifted to an apartment in Lajpat Nagar to escape from Pandit's men and had reportedly even complained to the police about the threat to his life.    Police said that Pandit's gang was trailing Rao for the past 20 days. Gangwal was aware of this and had ordered his men to conduct a recee in the areas before Rao visited them.    Sangam Vihar was once a playing field of at least six organized gangs, each with 20-30 men including Gangwal, Chauhan and Khatik. Cops said that Gangwal moved to real estate, including settling property disputes, and also gained control over the water tankers. He soon developed a rivalry with Chauhan operating a similar syndicate around Sainik Farms and Neb Sarai.    "Initially the fights were limited to scuffles between gang members. But gradually they started getting weapons from Meerut ordered over the phone," said a police officer.    Gangwal was jailed in 2014 for the murder of two juveniles associated with Chauhan's gang. In retaliation, Chauhan had stabbed Gangwal's right hand man Sachin who led the gang in his absence. Sachin was later knifed to death in August 2014 by two juveniles employed by Chauhan. Sources said that before Gangwal could take revenge, Chauhan was arrested in a murder case.    With Chauhan out of the way, Gangwal tried to control an illegal scrap dealing business and gave orders to his gang members over the phone. Earlier this year, he appointed Raju Rao to look after the gang's finances. He had even orchestrated the murder of one of Chauhan's associates running the scrap business. In may this year, Chauhan was stabbed to death inside Tihar Jail by Gangwal's men.    Chauhan's gang remained headless for sometime until Deepak Pandit took over. "He vowed to avenge Chauhan's death and kill Gangwal's men to establish supremacy over the area," said a police officer.  ||NEW DELHI

When asked if the Talwars had given their consent to make this film, Vishal clarified, "We have not taken their permission. When we started researching on the case, we found bizarre contradictory things and each point of view had its own conviction. So, we thought why not present all these three versions, like the film called Rashomon.    It had three different point of views of a murder. So, we have presented the conviction of all three."    Irrfan attributed his presence in the film to the power of the story. "When I read this script, there were different versions of the story, but still there were such powerful emotions in it. That is what compelled me to do the film."    Konkona reasoned, "The script has looked at every possible aspect of the investigation."

They slammed the UP government for creating a 'jungle raj' in the state and making the atmosphere unsafe for women.     "Mulayam Singh Yadav is in the habit of making sexist comments. It is extremely insensitive of him to make such a statement. Gang rapes have become common in the state and yet the SP leader can't see the ground reality. He must apologize for his deplorable comments," Parvesh Tyagi, BJP district vice-president and member of BJP Mahila Morcha, said. The SP supremo had recently said that rape by four men was "impractical".     Slamming the situation in the state, Tyagi said, "Women get raped and murdered on a regular basis. Incidents of eve-teasing and chain-snatching are on the rise. Women do not feel safe to step out of their homes. They have lost their freedom in UP."     Taking on state cabinet minister Azam Khan, Tyagi added, "When Khan was in Meerut, he said he was satisfied with the state's law and order situation. How can anybody be satisfied with such a scenario? The only way the condition of women in UP will improve is if the SP government is removed from power."     ||MEERUT

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU

"It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:35 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:35 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:35 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:35 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU

From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:35 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Harindham was residing on the second floor of a house where Sathya was staying on rent. Sathya, who was sleeping in the house, caught him red-handed when he tried to steal her phone. When she raised an alarm, he killed her by slitting her throat with a knife and escaped with her cellphone, according to the police.     The police nabbed him by tracing the IMEI (international mobile equipment identity) number of the cellphone.     Harindham had sold the mobile phone to a cellphone shop owner at Koyambedu. The shop owner had taken his photo on suspicion that it could be a stolen mobile phone, the police said.     ||CHENNAI

This should never happen again... A crime is committed with a young girl where we don't know whether the evidence is compromised and we also don't know if justice will be served or not. This has been a travesty (of justice), " Konkana told reporters here last evening at the film's trailer launch."If a 13-year-old girl dies, you should know what is going on and the guilty should be punished. This should never happen and hopefully we should never make a film like this."The 35-year-old actress, who plays Aarushi's mother Nupur in the film, found the role challenging."I found it (film) very interesting as a performer. It is an investigative thriller, we have shown various aspects of investigation in the case."There are (various) versions of this investigation, where (in one) parents are found to be innocent or (in another) parents are found to be guilty or (in another version) someone else is believed to be guilty. As a performer, it was challenging and interesting," she said.Being a mother herself in real life, Konkana could understand the emotions of her character."It is heartless if you don't move emotionally. It was a horrific tragedy. As a mother also...it has had more impact to enact the scenes," Konkana said."But at the same time I don't think you have to be a mother to understand the horrific nature of this tragedy, human empathy is such that you can understand the misfortune."The film features actor Irrfan Khan in the role of an investigative officer.Konkana, who worked with Irrfan in 2007 film Life In A...Metro, said both have them are respectful towards each other."I think we have always been respectful and cordial and shy.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pak-media-blames-India-for-cancellation-of-NSA-level-talks/articleshow/48639646.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||ISLAMABAD: Pakistani media on Sunday blamed India for the cancellation of first-ever NSA-level talks by setting "pre-conditions" ahead of National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz's visit to New Delhi, in a blow to the efforts to normalise their bilateral ties.     Aziz was expected to discuss terrorism and other outstanding issues with his counterpart Ajit Doval but he called of the trip after India asked Pakistan to give a commitment that he would not meet Kashmiri separatist leaders.     All leading newspapers carried the story about cancellation of NSA-level talks on the front page, highlighting the Indian "pre-conditions" which, according to local media, led to the breakdown of parleys.     In a front page headline "NSAs' talks cancelled over Indian conditions", the Dawn blamed Indian conditions for cancellation of talks.     "Amid intense bickering, the government decided on Saturday to cancel the planned meeting of national security advisers with India, citing New Delhi's refusal to allow an expanded agenda and a meeting with Kashmiri leaders," it said.     The News International under the headline "No talks with pre-conditions, Pakistan tells India" reported that "without waiting to burn the midnight oil and succumbing to 'orders' from New Delhi, Pakistan responded to the 'hilarious' Indian directives by saying that it will not attend the NSA level talks on the basis of preconditions set by India."     It further said that in the final word from Pakistan, "thankfully, the war of words came to an end on Saturday night with peace and better bilateral relations emerging as the biggest loser."     The Express Tribune termed the cancellation of talks as blow to the efforts of normalisation of India-Pakistan ties.     "India's intransigence is to blame for the cancellation of the meeting between Aziz and his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval which was agreed upon by the prime ministers of the two countries in their meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in the Russian city of Ufa," it said.     The Nation carried a front page story "Stubborn India 'kills' peace hopes", saying India's attitude of inflexibility was the main reason for failure of purposed talks.     "An overbearing India yesterday dashed hopes for peace in the region by virtually murdering planned talks with Pakistan by putting 'unacceptable' conditions, though none of the two sides officially declared the death of dialogue," it reported.     The Urdu media and TV channels were even more harsh and squarely blamed India for the cancellation of talks.     Media also tried to portray that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government were not serious in talks with Pakistan and they just use the opportunity to address the domestic audience.||ISLAMABAD

He has confessed to have killed the pregnant woman by running a tractor over her, said OIC of Kinjirikela police station Bidesi Bag. Police have seized the tractor.    The 18-year-old girl was eight months pregnant. She had eloped with the accused about a year ago after their families opposed their marriage. The accused works at OSAP, Koraput unit.    Since the girl was a minor, the two had not formally married but had started living together at Koraput. According to sources, on August 18, the couple returned to Sundargarh via Jharsuguda by train. The constable had informed the girl's father over phone that they will marry in Sundargarh. After the girl's body was recovered, her father lodged a complaint at Kinjirikela police station.  ||ROURKELA
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/El-Salvador-prison-gang-violence-kills-14/articleshow/48639051.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||SAN SALVADOR: At least 14 inmates were killed in an El Salvador jail on Saturday when violence erupted between two factions of a notorious gang, an official said.     The killings at Quezaltepeque prison, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital San Salvador, were linked to an internal dispute involving the feared Barrio 18 gang, a spokesman for the presidency told AFP.     The prison was placed on lockdown and security ramped up, as about 50 people with relatives in the jail descended on the facility, some weeping and others demanding to know the identities of the dead.     A state of emergency was declared for 72 hours at the jail and authorities insisted that they were in full control of the situation.     Prison officials were alerted when some members of the "Revolutionaries" faction of the gang failed to return to their cells, said Eugenio Chicas, the communications secretary for the presidency.     Security agents and riot police found their bodies among some garbage bins, added Chicas, labeling it "a purge."     "There has been an internal confrontation," said Chicas.     The Directorate General of Prisons, on Twitter, said it was "presumed to be an act of purification among gang members."     The deaths underline how gang violence has made El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world.     On Wednesday, police said there were at least 125 murders in just three days in the country, a staggering toll even by El Salvador's standards.     "These are worrisome numbers. These are Salvadorans who are dying. Regardless of who is a gang member or not," National Police chief Mauricio Ramirez told reporters.     There were 3,332 murders between January and June, up from 2,191 a year earlier, government data show.     The Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 (M-18) gangs have an estimated 70,000 members in El Salvador, 10,000 of whom are behind bars.     The gangs emerged in the 1980s in Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles.     They arrived in Central America when the United States deported thousands of immigrants who had fled there to escape civil wars that had gripped the region in the late 20th century.     Criminal gangs have been pressuring the government to include them in a commission examining ways to stem endemic urban violence for which these same groups are, to a large extent, responsible.     Since taking office last year, President Salvador Sanchez Ceren has tried to crack down on crime and refused to negotiate with the gangs.     Last month, Barrio 18 ordered a bus strike and seven bus drivers were killed after they defied the gang.     By seeking to shut down public transport, the gang hoped to strong-arm the government to the negotiating table.     The ongoing violence underscores the breakdown in a truce the gangs declared in March 2012, brokered by the Catholic Church with behind-the-scenes help from then president Mauricio Funes.

Through this film, we have shown the investigations of the police...the CBI did the investigation, followed by a probe by one more CBI team. So there are three versions and we have tried to show that with as much honesty as we could ," Vishal said."It (the film) is not my version (of the case). With this case, we found bizarre things and each point of view had its own conviction and so we thought of presenting three versions.We have presented a conviction of all three points of view we have not given any judgemental," he added.Vishal said that through the film, the makers are trying to solve the case. However, the Haider director refused to give his personal opinion on who according to his research the possible killers could be.When asked if the makers are open for any kind of cuts considering the nature of the film, Vishal said, "The film is already censored in U/A and so is the trailer."The film, which stars Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Tabu and Sohum Shah in the lead roles, is slated for release on October 2.For latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain For the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain For more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia For latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment|| 
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/Urban-honour-killings-Backlash-against-change/articleshow/48638618.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||Thirteen years after the Nitish Katara case, families are still finding it hard to allow the young the freedom of choice.On Monday morning, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in the Nitish Katara case which first exposed the fact that honour killings weren't things that happened in distant villages. And that matrimony and romance are severely caste-bound even in India's seemingly sophisticated metros.News reports over the last few years suggest little has changed since Katara's horrific murder. Earlier this year, 25-year-old Kasturi and her husband Basavraj were stabbed to death in Bengaluru, allegedly by her brother, soon after they eloped from their homes.Less than a year ago, Bhavna Yadav (21), a Delhi University student, was reportedly strangled by her parents for marrying outside her caste. In 2014, a chunni was reportedly used to strangle Pachala Deepthi, a software engineer from Hyderabad. She was allegedly killed by her family for marrying a colleague.Feminist Vibhuti Patel says these incidents point to a backlash against the social changes that families are struggling to deal with. "Urban areas have witnessed an increased intermingling of boys and girls, and a more secular, liberal culture. The work participation of women has increased and the age of marriage has risen. A combination of all these factors results in more freedom for young people, who want to choose their own partners. Choice-based marriages are what challenge traditional norms, resulting in a huge backlash," says Patel, head of the economics department at Mumbai's SNDT women's university.Even a fairly liberal megapolis like Mumbai has had more than its fair share of honour killings in recent years. Take for instance 19-year-old Tabassum Khatun, who fell in love with her father's paying guest, Imran Khan. Her father caught them together one night in 2012 and banged the girl's head against a wall. She died soon after. Last year, a 15-year-old from UP who eloped with his 19-year-old girlfriend and landed in Mumbai, was killed by the girl's Mumbai-based father.Kasturi and Basavraj were allegedly murdered by Kasturi's brother in July in Bengaluru. (TOI photo)Most honour killings are "punishment" for breaking the caste boundary. "We need to understand how big a deal caste is. It is not merely cultural, but an intrinsic part of the social and economic fabric, cutting across religions. You can't maintain the caste system unless you control women," says Kavita Krishnan, secretary, All India Progressive Women's Association.C Parthasarthy, a software engineer in his 20s who married a girl from another caste, was abducted, killed and set on fire in Chennai in 2011. The men arrested for the murder included the boy's father-in-law. Then there was the headline-grabbing murder in 2007 of computer graphics trainer Rizwanur Rahman. You just have to look at the matrimonial ads in newspapers to understand the extent to which caste and religion decide social connections in urban areas."You can't look at urban and rural society separately. People migrate from rural areas to urban areas, bringing their cultural and social norms with them. Caste structures cut across religion," says senior journalist Chander Suta Dogra, whose book, Manoj and Babli: A Hate Story, delves into one of Haryana's most horrendous honour killings. Families, whether urban or rural, are generally intolerant of a girl marrying beneath her caste, class or status, she says.While honour killings are an extreme form of violence perpetrated on couples, Krishnan points to the need to examine the much larger prevalence of violence towards couples defying societal norms. Not all these cases end in a terrible death. More often than not families manage to dissuade or force girls from picking their own partners.There is very little outrage over these cases because communities are more or less agreed on the need to rein in women's autonomy, says Krishnan. "Girls are often held captive or forcefully married off against their wishes. Across caste, society and religion, a woman's autonomy, when it comes to marriage, is considered negligible. This forms the backdrop for honour killings in India," says Krishnan.Patel is of the view that economic considerations are supreme during marriage. The urban elite, she points out, often use marriage as a means of social and economic concentration.Irrespective of class or levels of education, families implicated in honour killings virtually never see themselves as criminals or offenders. You rarely see any remorse. Three years ago, Mehtab Alam, a garment trader in Kolkata, chopped off his sister's head with a sword and took it to the police station. He was furious that his sister, Nolofer Bibi, had eloped with a rickshaw-puller.||

The police began the investigation from the murder point of view only after the deceased's mother, Nirmaladevi Jha, a Bihar resident, shot an email to the city crime branch requesting them to investigate her son's accidental death on July 27 since she suspected it was a murder.     Those arrested were Hardik Vaze (25), Jitesh Rathod alias Pappi (32), Amit Patel (28) and Vinod Jain (28).     The Kandivili police had received a call from Shtabadi hospital about the death of a patient who was brought to the hospital and later died during treatment. The deceased was identified Kumod Jha. After the deceased's mother raised doubts over his death, the crime branch took over the invstigaiton. "During the probe we fond that Kumod was a property dealer. On that fateful night, he along with a friend had gone to a hotel to have drinks. When they came out of the hotel, four persons (accused) were standing outside. Accidentally, Kumod's friend's hand touched to one of the accused and they got angry. They got into an argument and one of the accused pushed Kumod who fell on the road and sustained injury at the backside of his head," said a police officer.     Kumod's friend took him home in an auto. "Kumod's wife and friend rushed him to the hospital after he vomited blood. We got spoke to his friend and got the details of the hotel, got CCTV footage and caught the accused. Pappi was previously involved in a murder case too," said DCP Dhananjay Kulkarni. The accused were handed over the Kandivli police.||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

However, many questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter. In many cases in India involving single mothers, grandparents are known to put in their names as father and mother.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Mikhail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43.    Mikhail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Mikhail     studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.

Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents.

A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:41 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Ieng Thirith, a French-educated revolutionary who was 83 when she died, was one of the few women in the leadership of the communist movement behind the horrors of the 'Killing Fields' era.     She was one of just a handful of suspects charged by Cambodia's UN-backed war crimes court, but was freed in 2012 when the case against %her was suspended after the court ruled she was unfit to stand trial due to progressive dementia.     Family ties helped her reach the upper echelons of power in a murderous totalitarian regime that tore children from parents and husbands from wives. The sister-in-law of late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, she served as the regime's social affairs minister alongside her husband, former foreign minister Ieng Sary, who died in 2013, before a verdict was delivered in his trial.     At one point this year, she had been hospitalised in Thailand with heart, bladder and lung problems. In the end she passed away in a former Khmer Rouge stronghold on the border with Thailand where many regime leaders settled after they were ousted by the Vietnamese.     The Khmer Rouge wiped out nearly a quarter of the population through starvation, forced labour and execution, in a bid to forge an agrarian utopia.||PHNOM PENH

The state also has the second highest number of rapes by minors, closely trailing Madhya Pradesh, which registered the highest cases.Countrywide too, the involvement of juveniles in crime has gone up, with 33,526 cases reported in 2014 as against 31,725 cases in 2013. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan registered less number of serious crimes by minors.Experts attributed this to better crime detection and reporting mechanism in Maharashtra which is missing in states known for serious crimes.As for murders by juvenile offenders in 2014, Maharashtra registered 121 cases, in which police nabbed 174 minors for their involvement. Madhya Pradesh registered 94 cases of murder by minors followed by Uttar Pradesh (76), Gujarat (62), Rajasthan (56) and West Bengal (43).The state also has the dubious distinction of recording maximum attempted murder cases involving juveniles, with 137 cases registered. Madhya Pradesh registered 102 cases followed by Rajasthan (84), Gujarat (43) and West Bengal (36)."The urge to do something different filled with thrill is a driving force that leads juveniles to committing heinous crimes like murder and rape," said child rights activist Yamini Abde, adding that Maharashtra boasts of highest internet penetration which gives easy access to crime-related and pornographic material."It adversely affects young minds and the increased aggression at a young age makes them more vulnerable to committing rape and murder," she added.Abde added that minors involved in crimes may have little education, but most were aware that they will not be punished as they were juveniles. "This absence of fear in their minds fosters disregard for police and judiciary. They then become reckless in whatever they do," she saidCertain amendments are needed in the Juvenile Justice Act, she said. "We should lower the age of classifying a juvenile. Besides, there should be standard operating procedures when it comes to registering a case against a juvenile. Staff in police stations in rural parts should be sensitized about such procedures of filing the case against a juvenile," Abde added.New Delhi-based child rights activist Bharati Ali said, "The duration of a trial in juvenile cases stretches for years. As per the law, the trial should be completed in six months in juvenile cases. This issue needs some thought."It can impact the child's psyche and restrict physical movement. "There are cases where the trials have stretched to 10 years. It shows laxity in our machinery. The rate of case disposal is very low and pendency is very high," Ali said. Maharashtra had 2,388 cases pending in 2014. She said the rate of increase in juvenile crimes was higher in 2012 and 2013 which came down in 2014.Advocate and human rights activist Rama Sarode underlined the importance of sex education to reduce involvement of juveniles in rapes. "Sex education teaches children to be more responsible and helps demystify misconceptions among adolescents. Similarly, many minors found involved in crime are from the lower socio-economic strata. Poor and impoverished circumstances usually lead them to committing crimes," Sarode said.P R Patil, deputy commissioner of police (crime), Pune pointed out that crimes committed by juveniles sometimes stem from high growth rate, rapid urbanisation and industrialization."Those left behind in the overall progress due to lack of education and opportunity, want to match the pace of materialistic growth, various privileges and luxuries life offers. This makes impressionistic minds stoop to any level to get what they want resulting in increased incidence of juvenile crime. Since Maharashtra is a state which has highest rate of growth, cases of crime are also high here," he added.He maintained that Maharashtra also had a higher rate of crime detection as compared to the other states. "Many cases remain undetected in other states, hence police do not know whether adults or juveniles were involved in them. Increased solving of cases is why the state has the highest juvenile cases in the country," Patil added.||PUNE

Around 9.30 am, the woman, who works in the human resources department of an IT company, was riding a two-wheeler when the man attacked her. The woman swerved the handle in the nick of time to dodge the blow and the axe landed on the rear view mirror of the vehicle. She then abandoned the vehicle and ran to save her life, while the assailant continued to chase her. The woman's plea for help eventually compelled the assailant to flee along with two accomplices, who were waiting for him on a scooter.    Passersby, who saw the commotion, tipped off the police control room, which passed on the information to Vishrambaug police station.    The victim, claiming to be unaware of the motive of the attack, registered a complaint against an unidentified person under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) with the Vishrambaug police.    Police constable Ramesh Chaudhar, of the Faraskhana police station, was able to source the motorbike's registration number with the help of people present at the spot. Based on the information, a police team, led by sub inspector Girish Sonawane, picked up the vehicle owner Amit Kodalkar from Janata Vashat.    Kodalkar told the police that his friend Santosh Maruti Jadhav (28), a resident of Balajinagar, had borrowed the scooter to meet a girl about a marriage proposal.    Sonawane said, "During interrogation, Santosh confessed that he had tried to kill the victim with an axe. His friends Prabhu Prakash Palkar (23), a resident of Taljai Pathar, and Somnath Dinkar Jadhav (29), a resident of Manerwadi in Haveli taluka, were also taken into custody for helping Santosh escape."    The police officer added that, during interrogation, Santosh revealed he had committed the crime at the behest of his close friend Sunny, alias Laxmikant Manohar Kshirsagar (29), a resident of Janata Vasahat, who was also taken into custody. "Kshirsagar had developed a liking for the woman but she had rejected his marriage proposal. Kshirsagar promised to pay Santosh Rs 1 lakh and even gave him a token amount of Rs 20,000 to murder the woman. Santosh then sought help from his friends to execute the plan," Sonawane said.    "We have recovered the axe as well as the scooter and handed over the accused to Vishrambaug police. Santosh works as a contract labour with the municipal corporation. Palkar and Somnath are unemployed. Kshirsagar is a small time electrical contractor," the officer added.||PUNE
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Murder-count-in-India-falls-to-its-lowest-level-since-1960s/articleshow/48635001.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||Believe it or not, the murder rate in India in the past few years has been at its lowest level since the 1960s. Even the absolute number of murders in 2014 was lower than in 1992, the year when the murder rate (number of murders per lakh of population) was at its highest.The counter-intuitive fact emerges from an analysis of data from the National Crime Records Bureau's (NCRB) annual publication, Crime in India.In 2014, the country witnessed 33,981 murders and 3,332 incidents of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The combined rate of the two crimes per lakh of population was 3.0 in 2014 and 2.98 in the previous year.A lower rate was last recorded in 1970, when 16,180 murders and 2,357 culpable homicides amounted to a combined rate of 2.94.While NCRB has data on the absolute number of murders from 1952, it has been reporting the rate from 1957. It shows the rate started increasing from the mid-60s to reach its peak in 1992 when the combined rate was 5.15, roughly double the level in 1957. Since 1992, it has been falling rather steadily.The state-wise comparison of the data for 1992, the peak year, and 2014 shows that murder rates (number of murders per lakh of population) have decreased in 26 of the 32 states and UTs that existed at that time. (To make the data comparable, 2014 figures of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana, Bihar & Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh & Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have been clubbed together).In 1992, Uttar Pradesh witnessed 12,287 incidents of murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It was followed by Bihar (5,743), Madhya Pradesh (3,753), Maharashtra (3,338) and Andhra (2841). Although the order is the same in 2014, all of these states have seen the absolute number of incidents dropping. Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand put together had 6,818 incidents, while for undivided Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, the number of incidents was 5,321 and 3,442 respectively. Similarly Maharashtra and undivided Andhra also saw a decline.In the past two decades, the population of all states has gone up by several millions and therefore the rate of incidents has dropped significantly, in some cases to less than half their 1992 levels. It is not clear why the murder rate first increased rapidly and then has dropped equally sharply, but what is clear is that impressionistic ideas of society getting increasingly violent may need to be revisited.||

According to the police, as many as 39 teams are working on the case and are trying to find the assailants. Three police officers, who played key role in investigating the case, have been transferred within six months. Social activists and members of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS) have demanded the government to speed up investigation of the case.    Unidentified men riding on a motorcycle shot at Pansare and his wife Uma when they were returning from morning walk on February 16. The assailants shot at them barely a few meters from their residence. Pansare succumbed to injuries five days later, while Uma, who was hit by two bullets, survived and has recovered since.    Meanwhile, social activists and MANS members have been organizing morning walks on 20th day of every month in Pansare's memory and spread awareness among people about the failure of the police in nabbing the assailants.    Social activist Satishchandra Kamble said, "Every time we meet the police, they say that they are investigating the case and find the assailants soon. They only tell us about the number of police personnel involved in the investigation, hours they were spending, the call details and the number of people they have questioned so far. When we ask them what's the outcome of all this, whether they got hold of the assailants or have any clue regarding them, all the police say that they are investigating. In fact, the police have failed to make any headway in the case."    "Three police officials who were playing a key in investigating the case have been transferred due to some reasons. We do not know whether the police are really investigating the case or passing time. We actually doubt the intention of the state government regarding the motive behind the investigation," he said.    On Friday, superintendent of police Manojkumar Sharma held a meeting of police officials investigating the case and asked them to speed up the probe.    The police have got CCTV footage from a school near which Pansare was shot at and have prepared rough sketches of the suspects. The sketches have been released, but the police are yet to receive any clue about them. Besides, the CPI members have also distributed around one lakh copies of these sketches in the neighboring districts and some parts of Karnataka, but in vain.  ||KOLHAPUR

Accused Ankush Shendre, who works as a bouncer at a bar in Nandanvan, was arrested by the city crime branch police within hours of the double murder. While the police have arrested only Shendre, the deceased's family claimed more than five people were involved in the crime.  Police said the duo's throats were slit and heads smashed with a heavy stone.  A close relative of the deceased said that Gautam had shifted to city 15 years ago from Bharatwada. Later, he called Patle with his family to the city and both started chopping grass for a living.  Their relatives said Gautam and Patle would take contracts to chop grass and sell it to Govardhan Nath Haveli, Wardhaman Nagar.  DCP (Crime) Ranjan Sharma told the media that Gautam's father Hemraj used to work for Shendre's father Prabhakar, a resident of Old Bagadganj. Later, Hemraj started independently taking contracts to chop grass.  "Hemraj started gaining good profits. Soon, people working under Prabhakar joined Hemraj. Recently, Prabhakar suffered losses and blamed his son for not helping him in the work. He even compared him with Gautam," Sharma said, adding that this enraged Shendre and he decided to eliminate Gautam.  Police said Shendre had planned the murder eight days ago. "He had bought a heavy rod and a knife to attack Gautam," said Sharma.  On Friday evening, Shendre offered Gautam the job of chopping the grass of his farm's grass. He asked Gautam to visit the farm. Shendre assumed that Gautam would come alone but he was accompanied by Patle.  Taking advantage of night, Shendre slit their throats one after another and smashed their heads with a heavy stone. He then threw his blood stained clothes into the Nag River.  Gautam is survived by wife, a son and daughter while Patle is survived by wife and two toddlers.  Cops suspect the role of more accused in the case.||NAGPUR

Two motorcycle-borne gangsters shot Mangay Ram, 50, outside a weaving factory where he worked in phase V of focal point at around 7.30 am on Saturday. Belonging to Valmiki colony in PAU Z-block, Mangay was a cleaner at the factory.    Police sources said miscreants fired two bullets out of which one hit Mangay in the abdomen and he bled to death.    Local sources said the man could have been saved had the PCR cops, who were first to reach the spot, informed the ambulance service. They claimed that Mangay remained lying on the road for around one and a half hours before cops shifted his body to the civil hospital.    ACP (South) Rajinder Singh Cheema told TOI that before dying, Mangay told cops that men owing allegiance to one Pradhan (head of a committee in the area) of Shimlapuri fired shots at him.    Police have booked Sudhir and six other accused (who were named in the FIR at Daba police station in Pinku's murder case) --Rakesh Kumar, Deepak Kumar, Sunny, Rinki, Jassa and Gagandeep Singh of Shimlapuri and Daba areas.    Police officials said Mangay was shot dead as he was the main witness in a murder case of his son Pinku, who was himself a don and was shot dead by six accused of another gang in a similar fashion in Daba area on August 14, 2012.    They added Mangay's another son, Vishal, told cops that the rival gang was threatening them asking not to depose against them in the murder case and had even offered money. But Mangay refused every offer resulting in his murder, he told cops.    The ACP said hunt is on for Sudhir and other accused. Boxer and Rinku are already in jail.    Police sources said two of the accused in the 2012 murder case are out on bail and they might be involved in the shootout. They added that Pinku also had many cases against him.  ||LUDHIANA

Ludhiana police has got the production warrant of Baljinder Singh aka Amarjeet Singh from the court and gone to Mumbai to submit it to the Mumbai Police last month.    Notably, Baljinder Singh was supposed to be produced in the Ludhiana district court in two murder cases, including one which he allegedly committed along with Baldev Singh in 2001.    On August 4, another team of Ludhiana police went to Mumbai to get Baljinder Singh, but Mumbai police told them that they would first need the approval of Maharashtra government to send Baljinder, who is convicted under a mass murder case, on a production warrant.    Sub-inspector Jagroop Singh, additional SHO, Dholewal police station, said, "We didn't know that special permission of state government is required to get a convicted criminal on a production warrant. We got to know about this when we reached Mumbai to get Baljinder Singh. Then I gave a written application along with the evidences against Baljinder Singh so that Mumbai police can get permission from the respective government as soon as possible."    "On Friday, I got a call from an official of Mumbai police saying that they would not be able to produce Baljinder on August 25 as they have not got the permission from Maharashtra government so far, which may take some time," he added.    In such a situation, Ludhiana police have no option but to wait for the approval from Maharashtra government.    "We will again get the production warrant of Baljinder from the court and then proceed ahead with the same process," said SI Jagroop Singh.    It is pertinent to mention here that Baljinder Singh alias Amarjeet Singh, presently serving life imprisonment in Kohlapur jail.    According to the information, Baljinder Singh and Baldev Singh are crime partners from more than a decade. They met at Manikaran Sahib a long time back and became friends. Thereafter they allegedly started committing crimes together in different parts of the country. Baldev Singh and Baljinder Singh have allegedly committed as many as eight murders in Ludhiana, Agra, Mathura and in other states too.      ||

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI

A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:47 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the village on August 28 to pay tributes to martyr Lala Lajpat Rai on his 150th birth anniversary.    Navdeep Singh of Hoshiarpur also climbed the water tank with Hitesh with bottles of petrol. On Friday, the state government had released a list of 1,000 people to be employed as linemen, though it had promised to give jobs to 5,000.    Speaking from the top of the tank, Hitesh said, "Let the government provide us employment before we get overage. We are waiting for the last four years and will not wait more. If the government failed to give jobs we may not hesitate in ending our lives."    Hitesh, 35, of Ferozpur had set himself ablaze after pouring kerosene on him on January 14 at Muktsar when Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was addressing a rally. He was hospitalized for over a week with 20% burns. He had clashed with policemen on duty and an attempt to murder case was registered against him. He is out on bail.    This was third such attempt in the past one-and-a-half years by the unemployed lineman in Punjab. On July 12, 2013, unemployed lineman Sarabjit Singh of Tarn Taran committed suicide by hanging and Raj Kumar of Fazilka ended life by consuming poison on December 1, 2013.    Unemployed linemen union president Pirmal Singh said: "In 2011, CM Badal had promised jobs to 5,000 unemployed linemen on contract basis. The government has provided employment only to 1,000 unemployed at the monthly salary of Rs 10,000 in 2011. List for another 1,000 youths was released on Friday while 3,000 still are waiting for the jobs."    Moga additional deputy commissioner Arvind Pal Singh said they were trying to convince both men to come down saying that a meeting of their union representatives would be arranged with the chief minister.  ||MOGA

On April 23, 1997 the city was shocked by the brutal daylight murder of Madurai corporation's ward councilor Leelavathi.     The gang of six, which committed the murder, included Maradu alias Nallamarudu, 41, who is the brother of DMK functionary Essor B Gopi.     He was sentenced to life imprisonment on February 8, 2000. "As he is convicted of several criminal cases, including murder, Marudu's release was cancelled," said Madurai superintendent of police Vijayendra S Bidari.     Marudu's arrest was a belated one, said a police officer. As per the provisions of his release order, he must refrain from all criminal activities after his release.     But on the contrary, Marudu continued to break the law with impunity immediately after his release.     Citing this, police officers in the district has then sought cancellation of his release order, but only after seven years police got the go-ahead to rearrest him, the officer said.     CPM MLA R Annadurai said the then state secretary of the party N Varadarajan had written a letter to the then chief minister M Karunanidhi voicing his dissent on Maradu's release.     Prior to 2008, life convicts who had completed ten years in jail were granted remission. In 2008, the DMK government reduced the 10-year bracket to seven years. It paved the way for Marudu's prompt release from jail.     On April 23, 1997 CPM councilor Leelavathi was killed by a gang of six people, including Maradu, who is the brother of DMK worker Essor B Gopi and allegedly a supporter of DMK chief M Karunanidhi's son Alagiri.||MADURAI

In his seven-page letter, Rajoana, who is an inmate of Patiala Central Jail, has said that after passing through long legal process of Beant Singh murder case, he was waiting the President to decide over his mercy petition pending in his office since 2012.    After Rajoana's death warrants were issued by a Chandigarh court on March 13, 2012, both Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) and Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) had filed mercy petition for Rajoana.    After he was awarded death sentence by Chandigarh court in 2007, Rajoana, unlike his co-accused, didn't challenged his sentence in Punjab and Haryana high court, following which, the high court upheld his death sentence.    In a letter written on Saturday, a copy of which was circulated to the media by his sister Kamaldeep Kaur, Rajoana conveyed to the President that he would "accept whatever decision he will take, but he won't bow his head."    Stating that militancy in Punjab was response of Sikhs towards "oppression by Indian government", Rajoana, in his lengthy letter, justified his action with help of lengthy narration of what happened in Operation Blustar in 1984 and in following years in Punjab.    "We didn't kill Beant Singh for any personal reasons or to create terror in the society. We did it to stop the killings of innocent youth in those days. I had even told the court that I was with Dilawar Singh (human bomb) on August 31, 1995 (the day when Beant Singh was killed)", Rajoana wrote.    Before 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Rajoana had announced from the jail that he would support candidature of her sister as an independent candidate from Patiala parliamentary constituency in 2014 polls.  ||PATIALA

The recoveries were made across six residential buildings within a half-kilometre radius in the Saguna Lichutala area. So far, eight people have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the trade. Barely a week ago, an illegal explosives racket operating between Suti in Murshidabad and Kolkata was busted.     Not only are the arms exact copies of Munger-made ones, this is probably the first instance when the police recovered guns and bombs from the same place. The gang is led by Prasanta Biswas (34), who was convicted for life in a 2008 murder case by a lower court and is currently out on bail. He is allegedly a Trinamool strongman in his area.     According to SS (HQ) Chirantan Nag and chief of the CID ATS Arnob Ghosh, acting on a tip-off, around 50 CID officers, led by DSP Anish Sarkar, raided the Biswas residence around 3.30 am on Saturday. Till reports last came in, the raids were still on. Twenty nine one-shotter improvised pipe guns, an improvised 9mm pistol, 69 rounds of 8mm ammunition, seven rounds of 9mm cartridges, 15 rounds of 65mm cartridges, 13 rounds of 70mm cartridges, 100 powerful "lal saada" bombs, four single barrel long arms and two double-barrel long arms along with equipment to make the weapons were recovered.     Besides mastermind Prasanta, the others arrested include Rajib Mandal, Nirmal Mandal, Susanta Biswas alias Puchu from Saguna Lichutala, Bhabanarayan Byapari alias Bhogi, Saheb Sarkar alias Shahenshah and Pratik Biswas from other parts of Kalyani. Puchu is also reportedly a Trinamool member.     Police said most of the accused had criminal records. "Either the accused were trained in Munger or a craftsman, who worked in Munger, joined them. The entire process to manufacture the weapons has the Munger influence. It seems the gang started making the arms for internal use, but later started to sell these to criminals near Kolkata," said a source.     CID officers said all weapons are sold at almost double the market price in Munger. "The single-shotter, sold at Rs 1,500, seems to be of the highest demand. The Munger ones sell for Rs 600-800. We have to find out who got the consignments," said a source. Police are unsure if the bombs were bought from Murshidabad or made locally. The bombs could not be defused till late evening forcing the authorities to shut down Lichutala GPRS School where the bombs have been stacked. "We had to declare a holiday," said headmaster Utpal Chatterjee.||KOLKATA/KALYANI

Property dealer Kumod Jha died on July 27. It was a minor tiff with four strangers that had blown up, said a police officer, when Jha and a friend had gone for a drink that day. While leaving the bar, Jha's accidentally brushed past a man who was with his friends. This led to a tiff and one of the four allegedly pushed Jha, injuring his head.    Later that night when Jha got home, he threw up blood. He died at Shatabdi Hospital.    Jha's mother Nirmaladevi, who later learnt about the tiff with the strangers, recently had an e-mail sent to the crime branch, about her son being murdered. Here, the crime branch took over. Deputy commissioner Dhananjay Kulkarni said they got footage of the spot where the tiff took place, leading to the arrest of the four men. â€”Mateen Hafeez  ||MUMBAI

The police have arrested the woman's former driver for the crime. He is being interrogated to ascertain the motive behind the murder. Police said that the accused had a grudge against the telecom officer after she sacked him from the job twice in a year.    The victim, identified as Swati Gupta was sub-divisional officer at BSNL and her husband Vinay Gupta owns a private college. The couple's house is in RK Puram's posh Shrinath Puram Sector I area. She was attacked late on Friday when she was closing the main gate of her residence after parking her car after returning from the office. Lal Chand who was her driver came there and attacked her viciously with a knife. He fled after attacking her.    Hearing her cries neighbours rushed to her aid. A profusely bleeding Swati was taken to a private hospital in Talwandi, however, doctors pronounced her dead.    Her husband Vijay Gupta is paralysed waist-down after a recent accident. Police officials on receiving the information of the attack reached the site. After looking at the footage of nearby CCTVs the police placed the attacker as Lal Chand. The police teams arrested the accused from his residence in the same area.    Jai Prakash Daniwal, SHO, RK Puram informed TOI that Lal Chand was Swati's driver. She had removed him from services due to his misbehaviour a year back. Recently she hired him again when Lal Chand requested her for a job. Two days back Swati asked him to leave after they had a heated argument. She even asked him to vacate his room. Lal Chand was furious over this issue.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Dabholkar-murder-rallies-rationalists-to-action/articleshow/48628423.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||Chandni Mehta was a believer. But when the family's Baba diagnosed black magic as the cause of her sister-in-law's persistent stomach pain, Mehta decided to opt out of divine solutions. "It was a stomach infection and a lot of time was wasted," says the 22-year-old. Mehta looked for a solution online and found out about the murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and his anti-superstition organization Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS). It has been two weeks since she joined the band of activists, the number of which has been steadily rising in Mumbai, as in other parts of Maharashtra. There are three new centres in the city for around 100 new members, mostly under 30. "More youngsters seem to be coming forward whether it is in expressing solidarity with our ideology or in taking action against superstitions," says Avinash Patil, executive president of MANS, through which Dabholkar fought to pass India's first anti-superstition Act. Earlier centres were in Dadar and Goregaon, while new ones are in Bandra, Jogeshwari and Worli. Mehta, an interior designer intern, is happy that she participated in two 'magic' programmes. These are designed to deflate claims of miracle workers through scientific explanations. Such programmes first attracted Stanislaus School librarian Mangesh Ghodke. For him, Dabholkar's murder came as a wake-up call. "I wanted to be a rationalist but kept postponing it as I was busy," says Ghodke. He and his friends were silent spectators of relatives throwing time and money at satsangs of Asaram Bapu and Aniruddha Bapu in Bandra East. Dabholkar's writings and YouTube speeches showed him a way out. Ghodke and team now organise awareness programmes for schools in their locality. In Jogeshwari, Sachin Nachnekar and colleagues were busy during 'naag panchami' to convince the devout that snakes don't drink milk and won't follow humans. Mumbaikars mightn't be into witchcraft but buy costly amulets and blindly follow godmen and tantriks irrespective of their religion, says senior activist Prabha Purohit. Infact, devotees often donate a chunk of their salary, says RBI employee Sachin Thite, who joined last year. "We are looking into a complaint from a government employee who was cheated of lakhs for a cure for his problems by a Khan baba from Vasai," says Thite. Most godmen in other cities have agents here too, says Nandakishor Talashilkar, a senior leader. Small-time tantriks splatter local trains with posters and phone numbers. "We had to tell railway officials that if they allow posters they could get into legal trouble," he says. The latest is the craze for 'mid-brain' activation of children for better academic results. "There are institutes in Malad promising to make children score 80% marks and more," he says. Those who make these claims have no proof but parents pay them. So far the activists haven't encountered violent opposition though seniors recall being threatened by right-wing political parties. "None of this is against religion. People who understand that, listen to us and ask questions," says Nachnekar. Sometimes, the biggest opposition is from their orthodox families, says Ghodke. But mostly they are happy that he is trying to help others. A small mercy indeed.||

The deceased, Sultan Shaikh (25), was flung into the air from impact of the crash on the flyover near Phoenix mall and he landed below the bridge, the police said.     DCP Sussairaj Jaykumar said, "The accident took place around 10.20 pm when the deceased, along with a friend, Farhan Khan (23), was on his way to Elphinston. The SUV crashed into the Scooty from behind, due to which the two-wheeler hit the aluminum sidewall (hardly 2.5' height) of the bridge. The deceased was flung over the bridge and died on spot." A police team rushed Shaikh to KEM Hospital in a taxi, where he was declared dead before admission.     Farhan, who was riding pillion and sustained minor injuries, lodged a complaint of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.     Wasani was arrested and sent for medical tests where his blood and urine samples were collected to establish if he was drunk. Prima facie, the doctor said, Wasani was not under the influence of alcohol .     In a separate incident, two youths, including the son of a constable, met with an accident in Kurla when their bike came under the rear tyre of a speeding truck. The pillion rider died in the accident.||MUMBAI

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukerjea, that is, 13 years after Sheena was born.

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:53 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Police claimed he had repeatedly violated rules and created law and order problems in the state capital while on bail.    Yadav is on bail in four cases lodged with four different police stations of Patna district. These cases include charges of forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, threatening a person, creating road jam, hatching criminal conspiracy and assisting in theft and for keeping stolen property in his possession.    "We cannot allow people like Yadav, who are on bail, to repeatedly violate rules and create law and order problems in the city. Three new cases were lodged against him recently here for instigating people to get violent and to forcibly enforce bandh. He has been booked for paralysing normal public life and vehicular traffic in the city and also for creating obstruction in performance of duty by government officials. We see him as a threat to peace in the society," said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vikas Vaibhav.    Patna Police lodged an FIR with Kotwali police station on July 15 against Yadav and other named accused for blocking road and interfering with government work. Yadav and others joined the protest march staged by SAP jawans at Dak Bungalow crossing, causing inconvenience to common people. They staged dharna there, which is a prohibited area, for hours. Two other cases of similar nature were lodged with Kotwali and Gandhi Maidan police station against him.    Yadav, who was expelled from Lalu Prasad's RJD for six years for anti-party activities, floated his own party, Jan Adhikar Party. Citing lack of evidence, the Patna high court had, in 2013, acquitted Yadav in CPM leader Ajit Sarkar murder case.    Sarkar had been killed on May 14, 1998, while returning from a meeting of party workers in Purnia. The division bench of Justice V N Sinha and Justice K K Lal set aside the February 2008 conviction of Yadav and co-accused Rajan Tiwari and Anil Kumar Yadav in the case.    ||PATNA

But he has reconsidered the role of violence in the quest for a Messianic kingdom of Israel, particularly as he contemplates a new generation of radicals he sees as bastardizing their shared ideology.Yes, the aging right-wing extremist is wringing his weathered hands along with much of the Jewish world after last month's firebombing in the West Bank village of Duma that killed an 18-month-old boy and his father. It is personal for Etzion, 64, who said he takes "partial responsibility" for not reaching out to the young zealots "to try and straighten out their thinking," which he described as a "superficial", "childish", "distorted" and even "vulgar" interpretation of Jewish texts.Having spent the decades since he was released from prison in 1989 mostly writing and editing books â€” while continuing to promote a vision of a third Jewish temple where the sacred Islamic dome now stands â€” this icon of the Jewish underground issued a one-page declaration, gave a lengthy interview to a conservative newspaper and went on television to condemn the Duma arson. Etzion said if he knew the perpetrators, he would turn them in to the police, prompting a backlash from some longtime friends."I can hardly find words strong enough to say how I distance myself from them and reject them," Etzion said in a conversation at his home in Ofra, the West Bank settlement he helped found 40 years ago."Violence has no role now," he said. "On the contrary, what's needed now is some quiet, an environment for letting a seedling grow. You need conditions, and violence contradicts those conditions."Etzion, in his own recollection as well as contemporaneous accounts of the notorious underground, always opposed attacks on random Arabs: He saw the mayors as legitimate targets, "the heads of the snake", but argued against his comrades' 1983 gun-and-grenade attack on the Islamic college in Hebron. Still, half of his recent declaration was devoted to sympathy for the Duma arsonists' motives; more than himself, he blames the Israeli government for, among other actions, releasing Palestinian prisoners.To visit with Etzion is to see at once the differences and connections between the old underground and the current crop of so-called hilltop youth, against a backdrop of an Israel growing more religious and settlements ever more entrenched.The extremists of the 1980s were educated army veterans â€” fathers in their 30s with a lot to lose. The Israeli authorities describe today's as mainly dropouts who do drugs, recruited as young as 13 and generally unmarried. But they share their predecessors' goal of replacing the democratic state with a post-Zionist theocracy as well as some of their tactics: Both Duma and the maiming of the Arab mayors, for example, marked the end of the 30-day mourning period for Jews killed by Palestinians."He's certainly a link in the chain," Tomer Persico, a Tel Aviv University expert on Jewish extremism, said of Etzion. "The '80s guys were much more ideologically sound," he added. "The new guys, they're basically anarchists. Even the few things they wrote down, you can see that their main objective is just to unravel the state and to wreak havoc."Sefi Rachlevsky, a columnist for the leftist Haaretz newspaper who wrote a book about Jewish Messianism, said he "wouldn't really believe" Etzion's mea culpa. He argued that the real change is the absorption of formerly fringe ideas into Israel's establishment politics, and said Etzion knows well that his agitation for Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount, the contested Old City holy site that Muslims revere as the Noble Sanctuary, can itself erupt into violence."To say that somebody who is still working to make the biggest flames about the Temple Mount, that he changed something about his ideas, that's nonsense," Rachlevsky said. "Yehuda Etzion's ideological point of view changed? Not at all. Did his morality change? Not at all. Is he ready to blow up the confines above the rock if needed for Messianic redemption? Of course."Born on a kibbutz to Yaffa and Avraham Mintz â€” a fighter in the pre-1948 Zionist paramilitary group Lehi â€” Yehuda changed his last name in 1968 to Etzion in homage to the first block of settlements built after Israel captured the West Bank. As a yeshiva student, he was a staple of the Gush Emunim settlement movement but was further radicalized after Israel's 1978 peace treaty with Egypt, which involved a traumatic withdrawal from Israeli settlements in the Sinai Desert.His guiding light was Shabtai Ben-Dov, a Lehi fighter who imagined a bloody battle that would bring the messiah. In "Dear Brothers", a book about the Jewish underground, Haggai Segal â€” who served time alongside Etzion and is his neighbor in Ofra â€” recounted how Etzion asked Ben-Dov on his deathbed whether removing the Dome of the Rock would be a wise first step toward redemption.Ben-Dov said it "would solve all the Jews' problems," according to Segal's account. When Etzion protested, "That's a very hard thing to do," his mentor urged, "Difficult, but not impossible."Today, Etzion says the plot would have required 40 people to carry out, and while his group had readied huge caches of explosives, they did not even have four members prepared to follow through."We made a serious mistake," he said, not in wanting to destroy the dome, but in thinking 20 or 30 men "can lead a whole people in such a dramatic direction by enforcement"."Such a huge project to be envisaged by such a small group of people is like standing a pyramid on its point," he said. "There is no alternative but to take the longer route, to work on the base of the pyramid. To make it a will of the people, an aspiration serious enough, so that the people will want to go back to their holy place and rebuild the holy temple."Hence his devotion over the past five years to "Jerusalem Rebuilt", a book showcasing sophisticated renderings of a future city with a new temple at its core. Etzion said he has not ascended the Temple Mount in several years, after some 20 arrests by the Israeli police at the site, "because I don't restrain myself when I go, I pray a little or bow down.""Even at my advanced age, I have not learned to respect and obey and say, 'Yes, of course', to every law that Israel creates," he said. "My criteria is the Torah of Israel."A father of seven with "20-plus" grandchildren, Etzion spends most of his time in Ofra, now a suburb of 700 religious families, in the heart of what Palestinians see as their state. He has edited 15 books, among them a four-volume, 2,800-page collection of Ben-Dov's writing, and has written five.With a biblical white beard and ruddy cheeks, Etzion wore sandals and a work shirt over his prayer fringes. He spoke in complicated, nuanced paragraphs as his wife of 40 years cooked for the Sabbath, at one point ducking in to apologize for a forthcoming noise. "That noise will soon be a cake," he noted with an eye-twinkle.Etzion described as "cowardly" the so-called price-tag attacks today's radical youth carry out against Palestinian churches, mosques and olive groves in response to Israeli government moves to, say, demolish illegal settlement buildings. But he blamed Israel's own actions, especially its evacuation of Gaza Strip settlements a decade ago, for inciting the ire."The young people ask themselves, 'Who is the state?' Is the state on the side of the house that was built in the land of Israel, or on the side of the bulldozer that has come to destroy it?" he said. "The more the youth decide the state is the bulldozer, they say, 'I'm against,' and 'I'm ready to throw a firebomb at the bulldozer.'"||OFRA (WEST BANK)

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/He-thought-his-brothers-body-would-never-surface/articleshow/48619074.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Satheesh Kumar R S (35) of Kalloor near Vizhinjam, who is accused of murdering his younger brother Shaji and dumping the body in sea, had hoped that the body would never surface like in the recent drowning cases at Kovalam in which victims' bodies were never recovered, said police.     The police on Friday recorded his arrest after completing preliminary interrogation on Thursday.     Neyyatinkara DSP S Suresh Kumar said that Kumar, a newspaper agent, was well aware of the recent drowning incidents and thus dumped the body into the sea from harbour area near Vizhinjam Kurissadi region.     "However, the cause of death was not drowning but strangling, according to the postmortem report," said the DSP. According to Kumar, he picked up a fight with his brother in front of their house at Kalloor on August 14 night. Shaji was in an inebriated state and he was rendered unconscious after he fell and smashed his head on the ground after he was kicked on his chest by Satheesh.     Satheesh, who went inside the house returned after some time and checked Shaji and thought that he was dead. He then brought some plastic ropes, a towel and a gunny bag to dispose of the body. When he was stuffing the body in the sack, Shaji regained consciousness and Satheesh used the towel in his hand to strangulate Shaji. He then carried the gunny bag to the harbour area and dumped the body in sea.     A day later, Satheesh also called his father from an unknown number, pretending as a friend of Shaji, and told that he had gone to Ernakulam and would return only after a few days. He did this to ensure that the family would not file a missing complaint, Suresh Kumar said.     But sea spoiled Satheesh's plans as the gunny bag washed ashore at Kanjiramkulam, not too far away from Vizhinjam, on the third day on August 17. Since the body was putrefying and unidentifiable, he remained confident that he would never be caught.     The DSP also told that Shaji was involved in illegal sand mining in the coastal region. He was an alcohol addict and had caused troubles to his family. Fights in this regard were regular a affair between the brothers.     Satheesh was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM

Instead of the usual festivities, the college community had gathered to pay tributes to Thasni Basheer (21) who died in an accident at the college two days ago.     However, grief was not the only emotion on display. The KSU and ABVP activists used the occasion to target the SFI.     By around 12.25pm, Thasni's body was brought to the college. The body was kept there for 30 minutes, when students and faculty members paid their respects. K S Sabarinadhan MLA, also an alumnus of the college, V Sivankutty MLA, CPM district secretary Kadakampally Surendran and BJP state president V Muraleedharan also offered their tributes.     The protests began the moment the ambulance carrying Thasni's body left the college. KSU activists barged into the administrative block and staged a sit-in in front of principal J David's room, demandng his resignation. The BJP/RSS activists took their spot outside the office room and shouted slogans against the SFI and the college management.     A police team led by deputy commissioner (law and order) K Sanjaykumar Gurudin managed to clear them. The team proceeded to the men's hostel located outside the campus next and carried out a raid. Police have altered the sections under which the suspects have been booked â€” from attempt to murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A case has been registered against 15 students besides prime suspect Baiju. The DCP said the suspects were still on the run.     ||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM

The other three were part of the group that exchanged fire with police at Tandigi on July 31," said SP (Malkangiri) Mitrabhanu Mohapatra.    In Kandhamal, security forces exchanged fire with Maoists late on Thursday. "Around 20 Maoists were in the camp. They managed to flee under the cover of darkness.

Special court of Dewas had rejected anticipatory bail application of Puar on July 8, following which he had applied for anticipatory bail application before HC, on the ground that he is from reputed family and cooperated in judicial matter.     Puar's lawyer Ashok Verma said, "We have withdrawn our anticipatory bail application." Without specifying the reason for withdrawal, Verma said they had decided to make some change in their legal position due to personal reason.     On June 17, a special court in Dewas had granted bail to Vikram Singh so that he could be crowned king and take over reins from his ailing father, Tukoji Rao Puar, a former minister and maharaja of the erstwhile Dewas royal family. On June 19, Tukoji died at a hospital in Indore and Vikram Singh, after getting anticipatory bail, was crowned king on June 20 in a private ceremony.     Puar had applied for extension of anticipatory bail in July, which was rejected by special court of Dewas.     Vikram Singh is accused of killing a man six-months-ago over a land dispute in Dewas, while 11 of his accomplices were, subsequently, arrested. He was missing till he got anticipatory bail on June 16. Police had filed a chargesheet against the 11 accused while declaring Vikram Singh an absconder.     On March 18, Vikram Singh had allegedly led his men in three vehicles to Raghogarh village, about 40km from Dewas, and clashed with Pratap Lodhi and his family members, who were harvesting wheat in their field. Lodhi, his elder brother Ramesh and a few others were injured in the attack. Pratap died two days after the clash and a murder charge was added to the FIR registered at Barotha police station in Dewas.     ||INDORE

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU

The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sheena-bowled-us-over-Rahuls-uncle/articleshow/48704552.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||DEHRADUN: Had things worked out as desired for Peter Mukherjea's first wife Shabnam and her family in Dehradun, Rahul Mukherjea and Sheena Bora would have been married for over three years now.     Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:17:58 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Everyone has a cold one as they appreciate Kumar Sangakkara's silky smooth off-drive.     There is a huge portrait that graces the pub, of Sir Donald Bradman and Mahadevan Sathasivam, the captains of Australia XI and Ceylon XI respectively in a match played here in 1948. The latter is one of the biggest heroes in this part of the world, probably adored as much as Bradman is around the world.     Ask every old-timer about the greatest batsman they have seen, and instead of Donald Bradman's name, the answer you will get is Sathasivam. They say his grace, elegance and poise at the crease were unparalleled.     The record books say that he only played in 11 first-class games, with an average of 41.83 and a highest score of 215. But more than his runs, those who knew him swear by the fact that he was one of the greatest gentleman cricketers from this part of the world.     However, there is a stigma attached to Sathasivam as well. He married Paripoornam Anandam Rajendra, a granddaughter of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan in 1941, and was subsequently accused to murdering his wife in 1951. There was a protracted 20-month trial during his which he spent some time in jail as well, but it was thanks to his lawyer Colvin R de Silva that he was finally acquitted.     According to Sri Lanka's Sunday Times newspaper, "On the morning of October 9, 1951, a little after 9.30, the domestic help, Marambage William, was scraping a coconut for the midday meal when the master of the house came into the kitchen, seized him by the hand and dragged him upstairs to the master bedroom. On the way up, the master said he had a job for the boy, and that was to kill his wife. Marambage William refused saying he would leave the house right away without his pay.     "The master went up to the bed caught his wife by the throat with one hand, her hair with the other hand pushed her onto the floor and started to throttle her. He ordered William to grab the lady's struggling body. When the lady had stopped struggling, the master went downstairs, closed the front door and returned," the newspaper said.     Sathasivam's lawyer De Silva clinically took apart the above testimony of his servant. They flew down forensic expert Sir Sidney Smith from England and his testimony was what helped sway the verdict. "De Silva was a member of the Tamil Union Cricket Club. He knew Sathasivam and his family very well. He believed in his innocence and that's why he chose to defend him.     "Everything was special about Sathasivam. He was a classy man and a great gentleman. We used to have drinks together. But after the trial got over, he was never too interested in cricket. He chose to go into business and we helped him get his life together," 80-year-old Renil Iyer told TOI on Friday.     "De Silva used to be a politician but he lost his seat because he defended Sathasivam. But he had no regrets," Iyer added.     Percy Abeysekera, one of Lankan cricket's oldest fans and a well-known face, also remembers the trial well. "Sathasivam was one of the most popular cricketers of our time. I heard even Frank Worrell came to visit him when he was in jail. But everyone believed he was innocent," Percy said.     Sathasivam might have been acquitted but there are still some theories floating around about a 'rocky' marriage and other woman by the name of Yvonne Stevenson, who he later married. Whatever the mystery, on the cricket field Sathasivam remains a hero for all generations.||COLOMBO

Police officers said that the men wanted protection for the family members of the woman as they claimed that this was the third murder in the family.     According to them, the woman Bimla Devi (65) was shot 18 times when by a group of men who had barged into her house on Friday morning. They said that Bimla's two sons Mahesh Kumar and Sandeep Kumar too were murdered in a similar manner, a few months back.     The family members alleged the reason behind all the three murders is a land dispute between the deceased family and a group of real estate mafias based in Mahendragarh.     They said that Bimla's husband owned a plot of land and apparently had a dispute with a group of locals over it. The accused men had even threatened the family with dire consequence if they did not hand over the plot of land to them.     "We approached the Police several times after the first murder but they did not take any action and when Bimla Devi was murdered last night we brought the body to Jantar Mantar. We will protest here until protection of our family is ensured and the murderers are caught by the Police," said Santosh Kumari, family member of Bimla Devi. They claimed that no arrests have been made in past one and half years by the local police.     The family claimed that they had approached the top officials of the Haryana police for actions and wanted the home minister to intervene into the matter.     However, they protesters were removed from the spot by the Delhi Ppolice later in the evening. The body was sent for a post mortem at the Lady Hardinge Hospital. The family members and have been asked to hand over a written petition to home minister.||NEW DELHI

The list includes DCP (New Delhi) Vijay Singh, who was involved in the crackdown on ex-servicemen agitating for OROP at Jantar Mantar on the eve of Independence Day. He has been transferred to northwest district, and his deputy, Jatin Narwal, has taken over. The transfer was termed routine, though.    The LG approved the list on Thursday morning, but it was not released for almost 24 hours as the Delhi government objected to the list being prepared without its consultation. Sources said the government wasn't happy that it was not consulted on the transfer of DCP Omvir Singh to anti-corruption branch.

Her naked body was found in a bush near a temple, and her belongings a few metres away. Police suspect that the woman was raped. A few people have been detained. for questioning.    Police said the women usually returned home around 8.30pm. However, she used to go to her sister's house at Mahavir Enclave if it rained and return the next day. "When she did not return on Thursday, we thought she had gone to my elder daughter's house. But she wasn't there," said her father. The family did not approach police thinking she had gone to a friend's house. All calls to her went unanswered.    However, the incident came to light around 6am the next day when a group of schoolchildren and youths found her certificates and belongings on road. They called up her younger brother. A few hours later, the body was found beside a Kali temple near Rani Kheda. The woman was to submit her certificates to get the job confirmed.    "The youths claimed that her bag was lying a little distance away from the body," her brother told police.    Eyewitnesses said it appeared that she was strangled.    Preliminary investigations suggested that the incident occurred around 10 to 11.30pm. The woman might have been dragged by the killers during which she dropped her bag. However, there were no signs of scuffle. The accused might have fled with her clothes before dumping her body, police said. They suspect someone known to her.    The woman's family had shifted to the area in 2013. Her father works in a factory at Wazipur industrial area. She had completed her graduation in 2012 and was involved in social activities. She had joined the NGO based in Rajouri Garden six months ago. where she occasionally taught children.    The family belongs to West Bengal and had shifted to Delhi in 1998.    The family members said the area around their house usually remains dark and has no CCTV camera.    Her marriage was fixed last month to a youth staying in Karol Bagh. The family members said they opposed the alliance as the youth was pursuing his postgraduation, in television production    but the girl convinced them. Her brother said the girl never complained about any harassment by local youths.    DCP, outer, Vikramjit Singh said an FIR under Sections 302 of the IPC (murder) has been registered and probe initiated. "We have not ruled out any possibility and further    Actions would be taken after the autopsy," he said. A forensic team was also rushed to the spot to collect evidence.    Police said her fiance and a few locals are being questioned.  ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Death-sentence-justified-for-kidnapping-for-ransom-SC/articleshow/48602771.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the constitutional validity of Section 364A of Indian Penal Code making kidnapping for ransom an offence punishable by even death sentence saying the provision is crucial as terrorists resort to such activities to force governments to meet their demands.     A three-judge bench of Justices T S Thakur, R K Agrawal and Adarsh Kumar Goel said the provision was incorporated as it was not only criminals but terrorist organizations which commit such crimes.     "Given the background in which the law was enacted and the concern shown by Parliament for the safety and security of the citizens and the unity, sovereignty and integrity of the country, the punishment prescribed for those committing any act under Section 364A cannot be dubbed as so outrageously disproportionate to the nature of the offence as to call for the same being declared unconstitutional," it said.     The bench, however, said such extreme punishment be awarded in the rarest of rare cases and only where a terrorist was involved in kidnapping.     "Where the act which the accused is charged with is proved to be an act of terrorism threatening the very essence of our federal, secular and democratic structure may possibly be the only other situations where courts may consider awarding the extreme penalty. But, short of death in such extreme and rarest of rare cases, imprisonment for life for a proved case of kidnapping or abduction will not qualify for being described as barbaric or inhuman," the bench said.     "The gradual growth of the challenges posed by kidnapping and abductions for ransom, not only by ordinary criminals for monetary gain or as an organized activity for economic gains but by terrorist organizations is what necessitated the incorporation of Section 364A and a stringent punishment for those indulging in such activities," it said.     The court said the legislature is presumed to be supremely wise and aware of the needs of the people and the court shows deference to the legislative will and wisdom. It said the court should be slow in upsetting the law passed by Parliament.     "Just because the sentence of death is a possible punishment that may be awarded in appropriate cases cannot make it per se inhuman or barbaric. In the ordinary course and in cases which qualify to be called rarest of the rare, death may be awarded only where kidnapping or abduction has resulted in the death either of the victim or anyone else in the course of the commission of the offence," it said.     The court passed the order on a petition by a condemned prisoner challenging the constitutional validity of the section. He was awarded death sentence in a kidnapping-cum-murder case under sections 302 and 364 A.     ||NEW DELHI

Their legs were also left broken.  The assailants had left the duo's bike beside the body. Police have ruled out robbery behind the murders as the victims' cash and mobile phones were left untouched. They feel it could be a fallout of either professional rivalry or family dispute.  Punitri was working at a farm at Bharatwada near Pardi along with brothers-in-law Someshwar and Prithviraj. The brothers-in-law used to take contracts to chop grass.  Sources claimed that Punitri had got a call on his cell phone from unidentified persons asking him if he was interested in taking a contract of chopping grass on 8.5 hectares of land at Talodi village.  Punitri had asked the unidentified person to come to Bharatwada to take him and his brother-in-law Someshwar. Prithviraj had witnessed Punitri and Someshwar heading towards Talodi along with another person.  It was after 7pm that the family of Punitri and Someshwar started searching for the duo. They were not reachable on mobile phones too.  Cops were alerted by passers-by who spotted the bodies and informed the control room. An offence was registered at Nandanvan police station.||NAGPUR

Rajkumar Kalshetti, the driver, was wounded on his stomach and chest. He is being treated in a nearby hospital. Police have arrested Dilip Dongre (27) and Akash Gaygol (18) both of Kaswarwadi on charges of attempt to murder.     R T Darwade, assistant inspector of Bhosari police station told TOI that the suspects Dongre and Gaygol are jobless and alcoholics. "They would harass other women of the area too," Darwade said.     Kalshetti, who also lives in the same area, suspected that the duo was teasing his wife. "A few days ago, Kalshetti had an altercation with the duo and had told them not to harass his wife," Darwade said. He was threatened with dire consequences.     "On Thursday night, when Kalshetti was on his way home, Dongre, Gaygol and another accomplice stabbed him with sharp weapons on his stomach and chest and hit him with a wooden stick," Darwade said. They fled the spot. "We nabbed them, before they could leave the city," he added.||PUNE

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board exam, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband, who she introduced as Peter Mukerjea."    The two-member Mumbai police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Mikhail twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Mikhail 's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time, he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Mikhail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Mikhail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI

Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:05 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI

Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES

Earlier, it was believed that Poonam was murdered by her family members because she had ditched her legally wed husband and was living with her paramour. Police are investigating the possible role of Chunni Devi's other family members in the murder.     Poonam, five-month pregnant, was living with the family of her paramour Devendra Jangu as his widow. In May, her legally wed husband Prakash Bishnoi was arrested for murdering Devendra. Prakash and his armed men had abducted Poonam and Devendra from their rented house in New Bhupalpura area in Jalore. Prakash is currently under judicial custody.     "Though, she was accepted by the family of Devendra as her second 'daughter-in-law' and was living in his house with his legal wife, Devendra's mother Chunni Devi blamed her for her son's death," said ASP Pahad Singh Rajpurohit.     Poonam was murdered in wee hours of August 12 in the same house. Her 'father-in-law' (father of Devendra), in his complaint to the police had alleged that some 8-10 persons had barged into the house, hit Poonam in her head with some iron rod and then strangulated her to death.     "We investigated the murder with different angles and the needle of suspicion finally pointed to Devendra's mother Chunni Devi. On interrogation, we finally succeeded in getting her to admit the murder," said Rajpurohit.     According to him, Chunni Devi got up in the wee hours of August 12, took a hammer and hit Poonam's head hard, when she was sleeping with her in the veranda of the house.     "After hitting her head 2-3 times, she strangulated her to make sure that Poonam was no more before raising alarm and cooking up the story of some attackers," said the official.     It may be recalled that Chunni Devi and her husband had given a complaint to the police against seven persons belonging to the family of her legal in-laws and paternals.||JODHPUR

Defence advocate Prakash Salsingekar said that the accused, Ramesh Saha, was earlier charged for murder. "The court however convicted him under the lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It accepted that it was a case of sudden provocation," Salsingekar said.    Ramesh, a rickshaw driver, lived with the deceased nephew Bindekumar Saha (23) and his brother Mithilesh in Santacruz (E). Ramesh wanted Rs 75,000 which Bindekumar had saved, but he refused to part with it.    On the night of July 23, Mithilesh heard his uncle and brother fighting. Mithilesh said Ramesh picked up a pestle stone and hit Bindekumar's head. Ramesh was arrested and tried before the sessions court.  ||MUMBAI

Employing an old tactic, Musheer Rehman, booked in 10 criminal cases, turned himself in for another case three days after allegedly helping the prime accused Laiq Abbas murder Victoria Street resident Taqi Raza.    The two bike-borne assailants had gunned down Taqi outside his house around 7am on August 11. While Laiq had been overpowered by Taqi's daughter and was arrested from the spot, Musheer managed to escape. He was, however, captured with Laiq by CCTV cameras.    Police kept looking for Musheer until an informer told them that he was lodged in prison in Hardoi after surrendering before a court on August 14. He was implicated in a murder case that took place in 2013 under Kachauna police station in Hardoi. Out on bail, Musheer's bondsman withdrew surety when he was being hunted, said a policeman. Musheer had committed three robberies in the city and had been booked twice by PGI police as well.    A police team from city visited Hardoi to question him and he may be brought here for questioning. Musheer is said to have admitted that he received Rs 25,000 for the murder and Laiq had promised him more later. "We would move an application before Hardoi court to secure his remand in connection with Taqi's murder," said sub-inspector Radha Raman Singh from Chowk police station.    Taqi was murdered over a Wakf property dispute and Abbas and Musheer were booked in two FIRs filed at Chowk police station in the connection. Abbas has been booked in 40 criminal cases. Police are yet to recover the motorcycle used in the crime.  ||LUCKNOW

Ten police teams were formed to trace the boy, Prakash Devasi, and nab the accused, Suresh Prajapati (21), an imitation jewellery delivery boy who is known to the family.    On Thursday, Prajapati allegedly slit 25-year-old Gatki's throat, kidnapped her son and called her husband Ambalal (26), who works in Bhoiwada, from her cellphone and demanded a ransom of Rs 1.5 lakh.    A Nalasopara resident, Prajapati is a cousin of Ambalal's business associate. Police said in the past, Prajapati had visited the Devasis' house in Sai Sahara building to deliver imitation jewellery. While it is obvious that he planned the adduction to make easy money, police are clueless why he killed Gatki. They are awaiting the post-mortem report to verify if she was sexually assaulted.    When Ambalal told the police about the ransom call, they asked him to play along. They placed a GPS in the bag containing the cash so that they could trace the kidnapper even he managed to give them the slip.    Prajapati initially called Ambalal to Borivli station to drop the money. When Ambalal reached the station, he got another call asking him to come to Dahisar station. Convinced that Ambalal was not accompanied by cops, Prajapati told him to leave the bag near a bus outside Dahisar station at 11.30pm. After 15 minutes, when Prajapati, who had brought the boy along with him, collected the bag, policemen nabbed him.    A case of murder and kidnap has been registered against Prajapati, who has been remanded in police custody.    ||MUMBAI

Police said the assailant, who appeared to be around 25 years old, followed the woman (name withheld on request), a typist at a college in Adyar, into one of the two elevators in the station, pulled out a knife and attempted to slash her throat.     When the woman evaded the first slash of the knife, the man stabbed her thrice in the right of her neck, an investigating officer said.     "He got out of the lift when it opened on the first floor," he said. "The station was teeming with commuters at the time and many witnesses reported that he ran through the crowd and to the exit with the knife still in his hand."     By the time people discovered the woman slumped in the blood-spattered elevator, the man had escaped. A witness called for an ambulance and alerted the railway police about the attack.     Police arrived at and rushed the woman to a corporate hospital in Adyar. On the advice of doctors, they later moved her to Government General Hospital.     Doctors told investigating officers that the woman's condition was stable.     A team of officers took a statement from the woman. The woman, who lives with her parents in Ennore, told them she did not recognise the man who attacked her but gave them a sketchy description of him, saying he wore a pair of grey trousers and a checked shirt. Investigators suspect the man had probably stalked her for some time, knew her routine and picked a time when she would be vulnerable.     The railway police registered a case under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) and launched a hunt for the assailant. The woman takes a suburban train every day from the Kasturba Nagar MRTS station to Park Town and then takes another train from Chennai Central to to Ennore. "We are trying to draw a portrait of the culprit based on the woman's description," he said. "We have also questioned commuters who saw the man for more details about what he looked like. The station does not have security cameras so it will not be easy to get an accurate image."     ||CHENNAI

The CBI gave five bundles consisting of over 2,000 documents, including statements of witnesses and medical experts, site plan and all forensic reports on the basis of which the investigation agency had concluded that the girls had committed suicide and were not raped and murdered.     This came after the families of the dead girls, who were first cousins, contested the CBI's claim that the two had committed suicide out of shame following a relationship that had been exposed. The families have always maintained that the girls, 14 and 15 years old at the time of their death, were raped and hanged by a bunch of men known to them in the village.     Advocate SAH Kaukab Naqvi, representing the families of the dead cousins, said, "We will study all documents which have been provided to us. We will highlight the loopholes and drawbacks in the theory of CBI to show this case is not of suicide." He added that the central agency has given all documentary evidences while audio and video clips made during investigation will be played in the court.     Father of one of the victims said, "We will fight till the end for justice as we believe that our girls were raped and murdered."     The CBI in its December 11 closure report submitted in Badaun's POCSO court said the girls committed suicide and were neither raped nor murdered. The agency said the girls took the extreme step "ashamed that the relationship of the elder sister with Pappu Yadav, one of the men earlier accused in the case, had been exposed. It added that the younger of the two sisters was also desirous of a relationship with the same man. Both girls, the agency claimed, committed suicide in shame after being discovered by an uncle.     Ever since the CBI filed its closure report in the case, the victims' kin have been seeking details of all case-related material that led to the conclusion that the deaths were suicide.     On the direction of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Court in Badaun, CBI had provided a copy of the closure report and medical evidences, including DNA, polygraph (lie-detection) and post-mortem results in February this year to the families. "However, medical reports were only partial documents and the local court had rejected the application of victims' families demanding copy of all evidences produced by the CBI. Hence, we had filed a writ petition in the high court in July challenging the order of the local court," said Naqvi.     The Allahabad high court then passed an order on July 22 asking the CBI to provide a copy of all documentary evidences in the next 30 days. "On Friday (30th day), the CBI called up the victims' kin and gave them five bundles of documents," said Naqvi.     ||BAREILLY

Almost all the schools, colleges, business establishments and petrol pumps remained closed and vehicles off the road. Though government offices were open, attendance was poor.    The district administration had made elaborate security arrangements and deployed police almost everywhere in the district to maintain law and order during the bandh.    Hundreds of CPI (ML) activists led by party's central committee member Sudama Prasad took out a procession from their office near eastern railway crossing at Ara in the morning. It passed through the main thoroughfares of Ara town and forced the traders to down their shutters.    Train movement was exempted from the bandh. The ML workers blocked Ara-Patna, Ara-Sasaram, Ara- Mohania and Ara-Buxar main roads. Road blockades were also put up at Shivganj roundabout and Patel Bus Stand at Ara besides Sandesh, Sahar, Tarari, Charpokhari, Koelwar, Piro, Isarhi and Agiaon. The bandh supporters raised slogans against the state government and the district administration. They also staged dharna at a number of places.    Bhojpur DM Birendra Prasad Yadav and SP Navin Chandra Jha assured the ML workers that the murder accused would be arrested at the earliest. Police took the body to Ara sadar hospital for postmortem after which the blockade was lifted.    Miscreants shot dead Satish Yadav, son of Judge Yadav, near Badgao village under the Azimabad police station area when he was returning home on his motorcycle after addressing a 'jandawedari rally' at village Narainpur.    He was a resident of Kamaria village under the Azimabad police station area.    An FIR has been lodged in which Rinku Singh has been named as an accused. But no arrest has been made in this regard so far. Sudama Prasad alleged Rinku was a member of outlawed Ranveer Sena. The CPI (ML) activists also took out a funeral procession from their party office that passed through the main thoroughfares of the town on Friday.    Meanwhile, the Bhojpur police, acting on a tip off, conducted raid at village Lahthan under the Agiaon Bazaar police station area on Thursday evening and arrested one Anil Tiwary, who had been absconding for 21 years. He was wanted in a case of murder of three CPI (ML) activists in 1994.    ||ARA

The victim's body was later found in a jute sack in Vikas Nagar area.     The accused including Omveer Singh Tomar, Sidhant Sirohi and Binny Dung were arrested from near the ISBT.     It is learnt that deceased Rao had a dispute with Tomar, also a resident of Turner Road, over a piece of land worth Rs 2.5 crore and allegedly hatched a conspiracy to eliminate him. For this, Tomar allegedly sought help of his friends including Sirohi, Dung, Gurender Sardar and Saravjeet Singh. Gurender and Saravjeet are currently lodged in Saharanpur jail after the UP police found them in possession of arms on August 11.     Giving details, DIG Pushpak Jyoti said accused Tomar called Rao near the court premises on August 3 to discuss the sale of land. "Rao arrived at the spot and Tomar's five accomplices were already waiting for him at a secluded location in Vikas Nagar area on the outskirts of Dehradun. They had gagged him and strangled him to death with electricity wires. The accused packed the body in a jute sack and planned to throw it down the hill but due to vehicular traffic, they disposed it of near the main road and fled."     The DIG said accused Gurender and Saravjeet were currently lodged in Saharanpur jail after the UP police found them with the possession of arms on August 11.     The arrested persons told the police that Rao used to create hindrances in their property deals, which affected their businesses.     ||DEHRADUN
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/Ukhand-one-of-the-safest-places-for-elderly/articleshow/48591512.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||DEHRADUN: Reaffirming Uttarakhand's reputation for being a haven for the elderly, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data released a few days ago shows that crime against the elderly was negligible in the hill state with not a single person above the age of 60 having been murdered in the state last year. In comparison, neighboring states like Uttar Pradesh had as many as 174 senior citizen murders committed in 2014.     Clinical psychologist Veena Krishnan says that the findings should not come as a surprise. "The spiritual culture prevalent in the state, which is also referred to as 'devbhoomi', is the major reason behind the high respect that is given to elders here. People are extremely god-fearing and that is the reason why crime against the elderly is non-existent." Another reason, she adds, is the culture of close-knit families in the state. "Most retired people prefer to settle in Uttarakhand because of the salubrious climate. The locals are welcoming of them and respect the seniors who have settled here."     Besides Uttarakhand, a few other hill states like Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Nagaland and Sikkim have also emerged as safe places for the elderly with no senior citizen murder recorded here. Among the other hill states, Himachal Pradesh witnessed the killing of six elderly persons in 2014 whereas Manipur and Mizoram had three murders each, and one person above 60 years was killed in Tripura.     Pushpak Jyoti, deputy inspector general of police, Dehradun, says that strict police vigil has ensured a low incidence of crime against the seniors. "We are maintaining a senior citizen register and regular meetings are being organised with them to take their feedback on various issues related to their security. As a result, there has been a decline in all forms of crime against them."     He added that due to large scale awareness campaigns organised by Doon police, elderly people in large numbers are also approaching police stations for the verification of their domestic staff. "Earlier, there were some cases where domestic staff had looted their elderly employers, but after the strict verification drive, there is a sense of fear among the domestics which is helping in curbing crime."||DEHRADUN

The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/A-jolly-good-fellow-say-Khannas-friends/articleshow/48704630.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani Mukerjea's second husband and suspected ally in Sheena Bora's killing, may be the most surprising element in this macabre drama, but his friends and associates in Kolkata refused to cast aspersions on "Sanju" just yet.     From being the biggest dart enthusiast at one of Kolkata's poshest clubs (the CC&FC) to having a finger in every pie, Sanjeev was everyone's "best mate" and go-to guy who friends described as: "A doer... someone who could get things done."     The morning after Khanna's arrest, TOI spoke to Ajay Rawla, the man who Khanna worked for as a consultant and whose house he was picked up from on Wednesday afternoon. "It wasn't like he was hiding like a desperate fugitive in my house. We had a meeting in the morning after which he drove me home and that's when news broke on television. We were sitting, watching, wondering what steps to take when the police arrived," explained Rawla.     Seven years his senior, Khanna's association with Rawla dates back to the time they went to Mayo College in Ajmer. Later, Khanna went on to become an aide for Rawla's pet projects. Besides running his own business in wireless communications, Khanna was there setting up chef Shaun Kenworthy and Rawla's restaurant 1658 or immersed in the heritage project of converting the Bawali Rajbari into a hotel. "He was getting all the construction work and labourers in place. He was very good in helping out with permissions through his connections with excise and contractors," remembers Kenworthy.     Khanna, who seldom missed his outings at the club, motor rallies and horse racing as a prominent face in the social circuit, was not the same man before he met Indrani, recounts Bull Banthia, a close friend. "Well-read and well-versed, Sanju had a great mechanical mind with a solution for everything," is how Bull chose to describe his "jolly good friend who loved meeting new people, hung out at the club but wasn't a social climber". "It was Indrani who emerged as this socialite and drove him to consciously build contacts with those higher up in the social rung after marriage," said the Kolkata-based entrepreneur. "That's the reason why I distanced myself from them until overnight she left Kolkata with their daughter and Sanju's wallet."     While Indrani never surfaces in conversations, his daughter Vidhie, who stayed with Indrani, is a fond subject with his friends. "He would miss his daughter but was resigned to fate, hoping that someday she would find him," said Rawla, adding, "It was Vidhie who called Sanjeev on Wednesday to give him the news."     No one seems to know about any recent interaction between Khanna and Indrani. G M Kapur, a known name in Kolkata who was Intach's state convener and happens to be Khanna's "mama", seemed disturbed with "all the theorizing" of Khanna's role in the crime. He declined to look back on Indrani and Khanna's relationship but added, "The last that there was any contact with Indrani or her family was when Vidhie visited Calcutta last year to celebrate the 75th birthday of her grandmother (Khanna's mother who lives with him)."     Khanna's Facebook posts on "karma" in the weeks and months following Sheena's alleged murder on April 24, 2012, make for interesting reading. On April 30, Khanna shared photo messages: "Say whatever, whenever the f*** you want to"; "Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out".     On May 24, exactly a month after the alleged killing, he wrote: "You can never tell what people are thinking and feeling unless they tell you, and usually they lie. you ask them, 'Whats wrong?' and they say 'Nothing'. You accept this because it's easier than digging for the truth. People smile when they want to cry, they laugh when they want to scream and shout. They pretend like nothing is wrong because they don't want to face the truth. Things aren't always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes you gotta scream and cry your anger and sadness to the world, because you can only hold it in for so long before something in you snaps. so when you want to cry, cry. When you want to scream, scream. Don't hide behind fake smiles, it's ok to not be alright."     ||

Two days after his mother, Indrani Mukherjea's arrest, Michail (25) on Thursday handed over a bunch of photographs and documents to Mumbai Police officials who arrived here for investigation. He claimed that what he gave to police was enough to prove that Sheena was murdered for 'both honour and property'.    What raised many an eyebrow was the mention of Upendra Kumar Bora and Durga Ranee Bora (who are actually parents of Indrani) as father and mother of Sheena in her birth certificate. Some questioned whether Indrani's parents lent their names to Sheena to protect their daughter.    Another thing that caught attention was the time when the birth certificate was issued. The certificate was made on April 30, 2002, the year Indrani married Peter Mukherjea.    Sheena's birth certificate may also raise questions about Indrani's actual age. According to it, Sheena was born on February 11, 1989. Some of Indrani's close friends said she could be around 19 years old when she bore Sheena because she had passed her board examination from St Mary's (Guwahati) in 1985. A year and a half later, she gave birth to Michail. Presuming her to be 15 when she passed out, Indrani should be 45 now, not 43 as mentioned in reports after her arrest.    Adding more to the suspense, Michail refused to say anything about his and Sheena's birth certificates. Instead, he merely said, "I will soon reveal my biological father's name."    Teachers at Sudarshan School here, where Sheena and Michail studied, said they only saw the children's grandparents. P Mishra, a mathematics teacher who was Sheena's tutor at home, said, "I never saw her parents. Sometimes, I would see her grandparents, who were old and caring."    The frequent change of place by Indrani after her board examination, too, raised suspicion about her life after school. One of her friends said, "After Indrani passed her board exam, we came to know that knew that she had joined Cotton College in Guwahati. Then we heard that her parents had sent her to Shillong for studies. A few years later, we heard that she had borne two children. Then, she disappeared. In 2003, I bumped into her at Kolkata airport with her husband who she introduced as Peter Mukherjea."    The two-member Mumbai Police team, led by inspector Kedar Pawar, questioned Michail, who on Wednesday, was the first one to reveal that Sheena was Indrani's daughter, twice during the day. The first round of interrogation took place at Michail's maternal grandparents' house where he and Sheena were raised. The second time he was questioned at Dispur police station.    Before he was questioned by police, Michail said, "Only Indrani knows the actual motive behind Sheena's killing. I believe there are multiple possibilities. Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukherjae is one of them. My mother did not like it. Property is another reason. I fear I might be the next target. She may try to acquire this (Guwahati) property."    Disowning his mother, Michail said, "The world knows about her multiple relationships that she had made for money and fame."    Pointing to a plot near his grandparents' place, he added, "My mother sold this plot a few years ago because she needed money to clear her loans. It was in my grandmother's name."  ||GUWAHATI

Shabnam's brother Shaleen Singh told TOI on Thursday that in 2011 Rahul brought Sheena to their sprawling home in Dehradun to seek approval from the family for their marriage.     The entire family-Shabnam, her younger brother Shaleen, father Anand Singh and mother Seema-were reportedly bowled over by Sheena's jovial nature and affection towards the elderly people. Impressed, the family gave its "unqualified and unanimous approval" for the wedding, which was supposed to take place within a few months, said Shaleen.     Stunned by the recent development, Shaleen said, "Sheena was among those rare persons who left a deep and lifelong impact on people. She was good-looking, a sweet person, clean of heart and good to talk to. None of us objected to the wedding."     Shaleen learnt of Sheena's murder through news channels. "It would have been great if she had become a part of the family. I don't know what was the cause and motive behind the heinous crime, but all those behind the killing of the jovial-natured girl should not be spared at any cost," he said.     A former model and tele-actor, 49-year-old Shaleen today owns the Sanskar International school in Jogiwala here. He recalled the last meeting with Shabnam and Rahul in April this year. "My father Anand Singh passed away in April. They had come to pay their respects but we did not interact much."     However, Shaleen said of late the interaction between him and his sister Shabnam was limited. Although Shabnam's farm Gul-e-Shabnam and Shaleen's residence Shankar Sadan are barely 200 metres away in Badripur, meetings between them were rare. While Shaleen and his mother stay on different floors of Shankar Sadan, Shabnam stays alone at her residence and is frequently visited by Rahul.     "There are matters in each family which we do not want to disclose. We are not against each other but do not interact much. She comes to meet our mother occasionally," said Shaleen, adding that Shabnam was passionate about painting and had a studio in her residence.     Shaleen denied having any details about the presence of Mumbai police in Dehradun. "Neither Doon police nor Mumbai police have contacted me over the issue."     Staff at Shabnam's residence said she was out-of-station but they were not aware of her whereabouts.||DEHRADUN

However, her husband has put forth questions that police have failed to answer. Though investigating officers confirmed Sathya was not sexually assaulted before she was killed, they leaked to some section of media saying that they changed their stance on Wednesday and said there were indications of attempt to rape on the deceased.     Police personnel revealed the details soon after Sathya's husband Dr P Sesu, also employed at a primary health centre in Perambalur, expressed certain doubts.     He alleged the police hastily solved the case citing the state assembly, which is in motion. Sathya was found dead at her house in Kilpauk on August 20.     On August 23, police arrested Harintham Depnath, a BTech graduate, who lived at the second floor on the same apartment. Neither was there any mention about sexual assault or attempt on Sathya when the body was recovered from the house. The nor did the doctors. Police didn't tell this during the arrest of Depnath on August 23. "What forced the police to reveal about the sexual harassment attempt on my wife now?" asked Sesu.     "I want to live a peaceful life with my two sons - Tamil Nesan, 6, and Karmugilan, 4. The studies and the future of my children is important for me. I do respect the police personnel who spent sleepless nights to solve the murder, but there are questions that need to be answered," he said.     "I live in Perambalur with my children, but we speak through live video calls. I have told my sons that Sathya has gone to the God, as the Almighty likes her more. "Hereafter, we cannot speak or meet her. I don't know how far my children will admit it?" said Sesu. "I will approach the court seeking a fair probe into the murder of my wife. I want to find out the real cause behind her death. I want the real accused to get punished for his deed," said Sesu.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Woman-strangles-husbands-lover/articleshow/48704388.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||CHENNAI: A woman beat up and strangled her husband's partner, an assistant professor at a polytechnic in Choolaimedu, in their Thiruverkadu home on Thursday, police said. A court later remanded the accused, 32-year-old Shruti, in judicial custody.     Police said Sambasivam, a professor at Panimalar Engineering College in Poonamallee, used to bring Rajalakshmi, home frequently and introduced her to his wife Shruti as a colleague. He even dropped her home at night. The polytechnic where Rajalakshmi worked was part of the Panimalar group of educational institutions. Shruti initially believed the two were just colleagues until Sambasivam came home with Rajalakshmi on Tuesday and said the woman was moving in with them permanently.     On Wednesday morning, Sambasivam allegedly tied a 'mangalsutra' to Rajalakshmi in front of his wife, police said, based on Shruti's confession. A shocked Shruti picked up a fight with Sambasivam who asked her to maintain a cordial relationship and take care of Rajalakshmi. On Thursday morning, after he left for college a fight broke out between the two women.     Police said Rajalakshmi allegedly abused Sruthi and went into the bathroom. Sruthi followed her in and strangled her with the 'mangalsutra'. She then tried to make it appear that the woman had fainted in the bathroom. She took her in an autorickshaw to a nearby hospital where she was declared 'brought dead'. Doctors who noticed a few marks around her neck informed the Thiruverkadu police who registered a case of suspicious death under CrPC section 176.     The body was sent for postmortem to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital.     After finding that the two women were at home at the time of the death, police interrogated Sruthi for more than an hour but she continued to maintain that Rajyalakshmi had died of injuries sustained when she fell down in the bathroom.     "She confessed to the murder when we told her that her fingerprints had been lifted from the scene of crime," said an investigating officer. "She said she had smashed the woman's head against the wall and later strangled her with the 'thali'." Police altered the case to murder and arrested Sruthi.     Initial inquiries revealed that Rajalakshmi had been married to a man named Rajasekhar for a while and they had separated. She then got married to Suresh, a relative who worked in a private firm, a few years ago and the couple moved into a house in Mogappair.     They allegedly had frequent quarrels as he tortured her and she left him too, police found.     Rajalakshmi then got a job with Panimalar Engineering College where she met Sambasivam. The two became friends and began seeing each other. Rajalakshmi recently moved to the polytechnic in Choolaimedu, police said.     ||CHENNAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-journalists-killer-annoyed-colleagues-Ex-boss/articleshow/48704167.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||ROANOKE, United States: The disgruntled former US television station employee who murdered two journalists had "annoyed" colleagues but showed no signs at work of any mental health issues, his former boss said Thursday.     Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, worked as a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia from March 2012 to February 2013, but was dismissed for poor performance and angry behavior, general manager Jeffrey Marks said.     On Wednesday, Flanagan shot and killed two of the CBS affiliate's journalists while they were conducting an on-air interview. He later fatally shot himself.     "We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those two and a half years" since he was fired, Marks told a news conference flanked by dozens of staff, many of them holding hands.     "I don't think we identified that he had mental health issues. We certainly identified that he had performance issues."     Marks defended the station's hiring record and said its parent company had "a very elaborate program to screen employees."     Flanagan passed background checks and came with only positive references, Marks said.     It was only after he was hired, Marks said, that things went downhill.     "Vester's behavior annoyed a lot of people in the news station," Marks said.     Flanagan, who went by the on-screen name Bryce Williams, alleged in a manifesto faxed to ABC News that he was discriminated against as a gay, black journalist.     Marks said accusations in 2013 that he was treated unfairly were "immediately investigated and found to be without merit."     During his employment, Flanagan complied with demands that he seek medical help, but he was ultimately dismissed.     He was escorted from the building by police and made an ominous aside to the news director -- handing him a wooden cross and saying "'you'll need this'," Marks said.     As he left, he also made a "derogatory comment" to Adam Ward, the cameraman he shot dead on Wednesday.     Flanagan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil action suit, which were dismissed, he said.     "All of these investigations determined that no reasonable person would have taken any of the cited incidents as discrimination or harassment."     After killing Ward and reporter Alison Parker live on the air, Flanagan posted a video of the attack on social media.||ROANOKE, UNITED STATES
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Indrani-driver-likely-to-be-approver-cell-locations-match-events/articleshow/48703153.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||Mumbai: Shyamvar Rai, the driver of Indrani Mukerjea who spilled the beans on Sheena Bora's murder, is almost certain to turn approver in the case, said police sources.     The police now claim he was not involved in the actual murder on April 24, 2012, but stood guard outside the car at Bandra's Land's End as Sheena was strangulated in the car. Later he helped dispose of the body.     City police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who has been handling the case personally, said on Thursday that they have traced the person who had forged Sheena's signatures on a letter of resignation sent to the Mumbai Metro authorities, her employer, and another letter to her landlord giving up her apartment. The person claimed to have acted at Indrani's behest and cops have copies of incriminating email exchange between the two. His statement has been recorded. Sheena's resignation letter was mailed on May 5 and the landlord got the letter in July.     An approver in legal terms means an accomplice to a crime who confesses his or her guilt and gives evidence against others involved, usually for a lesser punishment.     The police decision to turn him an approver is significant as evidence in the case so far seemed weak with the Raigad police not conducting a post-mortem on the charred body suspected to be Sheena's that they recovered in May 2012 to find out the cause of death. They did not preserve the body nor did they register a murder or Accidental Death Report as is mandatory. In this scenario, it could be challenging for the police to prove Sheena was murdered, sources said.     Rai, who was arrested last week in a case of illegal possession of a weapon, broke down during interrogation and told the police Indrani and her second husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated Sheena while he kept watch outside the car in Bandra. The next day he drove them to Raigad and helped burn the corpse with petrol and dump it in the ravines. He said he acted on Indrani's instructions and received monetary benefits.     Asked if Rai would be turned approver, an officer said: "It is too early to say anything, but yes, we have kept that option open and will legally examine whether he will be helpful to the investigation.''     Rai's admission ties in with another important piece of evidence: the mobile call detail reports (CDR) of Sheena, Indrani, Rai and Khanna. The location in the reports confirmed Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at Land's End on April 24 and then travelled together to Raigad the next day.     On Thursday, Maria, with joint commissioner Deven Bharti, deputy commissioner (zone 7) Satyanarayan Choudhary interrogated Rai and Indrani together. They also supervised the teams that had gone to Guwhati and Kolkata, spending over 10 hours in Khar police station. Sheena's sibling Michail Bora and their grandparents' statements have been recorded. Khanna was brought from Kolkata to the city on Thursday night.     Based on interrogation details, police said Khanna brought sedatives from Kolkata which were mixed in water and Sheena was forced to drink it after she was pulled into the car near National College in Bandra on April 24. Once she passed out, she was strangulated by Indrani and Khanna. Then they drove to the Mukerjeas' family home in Worli and parked in the garage. Peter Mukerjea is believed to have been on holiday at that time. Next day, Indrani and her accomplices got a suitcase and stuffed Sheena's body into it along with old clothes and drove off for Raigad. In a secluded place, they burnt the suitcase with the body inside and dumped it into a ravine. It is emerging that Maria was tipped off about the murder two months ago and posted inspector Dinesh Kadam at Khar police station.     Sharda, Rai's wife, told reporters her husband was innocent. "My husband is scared of darkness. He never speaks to women. It's not possible he could have killed a woman," she said, adding that Rai used to work as an auto driver before joining Indrani's employment. The couple, who married in 2007, have an eight-year-old daughter and three-month-old son.     ||MUMBAI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-acquits-Romesh-Sharma-in-Budhiraja-murder-case/articleshow/48704930.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi High Court order acquitting former Congress leader Romesh Sharma in the case relating to the killing of fashion designer Kunjum Budhiraja.     A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and R K Agrawal dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi government challenging HC order.     The Delhi government contended that the HC had erred in acquitting Sharma but it was strongly opposed by his counsel and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who submitted that his client was in love with Kunjum and there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the case.     Sharma, who was alleged to be a frontman of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was convicted by a trial court on February 15, 2008. Kunjum was killed on March 20, 1999 at Sharma's South Delhi-based 'Jai Mata Di' farm house by a group of hired gangsters from Uttar Pradesh.     The trial court had convicted Sharma and five other accused in the case and had awarded life term to all. The HC, however, acquitted Sharma and co-accused Tejendir Verdi but upheld conviction and sentence of other four accusedâ€” Sharma's nephew Surinder Mishra, Hemchand, Santram and Ramesh alias Bobby.     While acquitting Sharma, the HC had said "Romesh Sharma and Kunjum were in love, and desired the company of each other. It does not establish that Sharma had got fed up with her". It had turned down Delhi police's contention that Sharma wanted to get rid of Kunjum as she knew about his alleged illegal activities.     "A grieving lover falling over the body of his mate and performing the rituals of a marriage can well be an expression of lasting love, and need not necessarily be a drama," the HC had said.     Sharma was in judicial custody at the time of the Kunjum's murder.     ||NEW DELHI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Raid-on-Bengaluru-centre-reveals-horror-tales/articleshow/48704718.cms||Tue Sep 01 09:18:11 IST 2015||BENGALURU: A State Human Rights Commission raid on a de-addiction centre in Jnanabharati Layout, near Kengeri, southwest Bengaluru, found 90 inmates living in pathetic conditions and subjected to inhuman treatment.     Thursday's raid followed the murder of an inmate of another de-addiction centre in Kothanur recently.     The SHRC raid on Sri Santhosh Social Service Society, also known as 4S Society, followed a tipoff. According to SHRC officials, the centre has been in existence for seven years at least, but the society couldn't produce documents of having obtained permission from the social welfare department. Commission officials said the centre had the permission from the DC and the DHO.     "Most inmates are between 20 and 35 years. They showed us signs of being physically abused. The centre has violated other norms too. Although it's supposed to have one nurse for every 15 patients and at least one in-house doctor and a psychiatrist, it didn't have any," said an SHRC spokesperson.     4 arrested for killing inmate:     Kothanur police arrested a de-addiction centre staffer and three inmates for allegedly beating to death a 28-year-old inmate. Dinesh was admitted to the centre by his family as he was an alcoholic. He was later found dead in a hospital. Family members noticed several bruises on his body. Narayana, an inmate-turned-staffer, gave some medicines to Dinesh, who later turned aggressive. Narayana sought the help of inmates Suresh, Subhan and Simon, to subdue Dinesh.     When Dinesh retaliated, the quartet overpowered him till he became unconscious. He died in hospital.||BENGALURU
